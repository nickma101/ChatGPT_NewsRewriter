Clouds, more than any other weather \u2013 the snow, the cold, the rain, the sun, the wind that touches your skin \u2013 talk to your insides. As though somewhere in your chest (or is it your head?) vapour is forming, changing shape, dissipating and forming again. It\u2019s why people need water: to feed their interior cumulus. A cloud below the clear blue of your head, and above your gloomy heart. Thunder and lightning in your mind, and the rest of you soaked through. Something wispy and white happening in your stomach \u2013 delight, nervousness.  Related: Rare \u2018mother of pearl\u2019 clouds spotted over Scotland  We wake up and look outside, practising cloud divination, searching the sky for something, anything, that will confirm that there is some relation between how the world is and what it feels like. We go outside, and if we are happy enough, if we have time to spare, we lie down on the grass and look at the sky and see shapes: the continent, the animal, the face. If pressed, we will admit that the shapes aren\u2019t real. But something in us \u2013 the clouds \u2013 believes something up there has seen Africa, a whale, a smiling man in a hat, and wants to talk about it.\u201cThe emotion is to be found in clouds / not in the green solids of the sloping hills / or even in the grey signatures of rivers,\u201d Billy Collins writes one day. He looks up on another and sees one cloud \u201calways moving eastward, from left to right / the way the eyes move over print / as if it were reading the earth with its blind shadow\u201d. Joni Mitchell looks up at dusk and sees \u201cfeather canyons\u201d. She looks up midmorning and sees something in her way \u2013 the word cloud comes from clud, or clod, and she sees this \u2013 a hill or \u201cmass of stone\u201d blocking out the sun.

            "text": "The Greens say the Albanese government has indicated it could be a year before promised new environment laws are passed, a delay that potentially pushes the revamp close to the next federal election. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said last year she planned to introduce legislation in 2023 to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act after major reviews found the law was failing and Australian nature was in poor and deteriorating health. That timeframe has been pushed out. In a statement last week, Plibersek said the government would begin consulting this month with more than 30 environment, business, and industry groups on legislation that would be introduced to parliament next year. She said the new laws were complex and the legislation would be more than 1,000 pages.  Related: \u2018Water is life\u2019: Indigenous musicians take Beetaloo basin anti-fracking message to Canberra  In a letter to Plibersek released publicly, the Greens\u2019 Sarah Hanson-Young said it was indicated during a government briefing for her office in September that the legislation would not reach the Senate for \u201cat least another 12 months\u201d. The independent MP, Sophie Scamps, and Hanson-Young said, given the delay, the government should bring forward one part of the promised changes \u2013 strengthening the \u201cwater trigger\u201d to ensure local water resources were protected from fracking for gas \u2013 and pass it this year. Scamps and Hanson-Young both introduced water trigger bills \u2013 Scamps in the lower house and Hanson-Young in the Senate \u2013 on Monday, and urged the government to back them. The water trigger requires the environment minister to consider the impact of large coal and coal seam gas proposals on local water resources. Labor has promised to expand it to include all types of unconventional gas development, including the shale gas found in the Northern Territory\u2019s Beetaloo basin, where fracking is a looming issue. The change is supported by environment groups, traditional owners and NT farmers. Scamps said it was a simple change that the government had already indicated it would support. She said it could be agreed and passed this week with backing from the crossbench. \u201cWith the threat of drought again looming large and the approval of new shale fracking projects in the Beetaloo Basin imminent, it is urgent that we act now to protect our water resources from potentially destructive unconventional fracking practices,\u201d she said. Hanson-Young said the bills would close a loophole that meant developments in the Beetaloo Basin currently did not have to be assessed for their impact on water resources. \u201cWater is life, but right now a legal loophole means fracking corporations have a licence to drill without regard for our rivers, the climate or the voices of traditional owners,\u201d she said. Plibersek did not directly address the call for action now, but said the legal overhaul would include an expanded water trigger. \u201cWe would welcome support, across party lines, to expedite our strong new laws through the parliament next year,\u201d she said. The Coalition\u2019s environment spokesman, Jonno Duniam, said the delay in introducing the laws \u201cshould be regarded as yet another case of embarrassing incompetence from the Albanese government\u201d. \u201cThe basic reality is that Ms Plibersek has spent far more time distracted by other personal priorities, including pushing for a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote in the referendum on the Indigenous voice to parliament, than on the core issues in her portfolios,\u201d Duniam said. Plibersek said she was getting the details of the new environment laws \u201cin front of experts early\u201d and would introduce them \u201cas soon as possible next year\u201d. \u201cThese are detailed laws and we\u2019re determined to get them right,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly won\u2019t be lectured by the Liberals who presided over these broken laws and, even worse, hid the review that recommended we change them. They have never been interested in protecting our environment. No one believes they are now.\u201d The Greens and the Wilderness Society said they were concerned the government was no longer promising to release the new laws for broad public consultation before introducing them to parliament. Wilderness Society spokesman, Sam Szoke-Burke, said the community had played a key role in pushing for environmental law reform - nearly 30,000 people and organisations made submissions to a review of the existing act by former consumer watchdog Graeme Samuel \u2013 but was now \u201cbeing shut out of the process\u201d. \u201cNo public consultations means that vested interests will be able to do their bidding behind closed doors with no oversight. In large part, only elite and connected actors will have access,\u201d he said. ",

She also said, \"I won't let the Liberals, who created these broken laws and hid the review that said we need to change them, lecture me. They've never cared about protecting our environment, and nobody believes they do now.\"\n\nThe Greens and the Wilderness Society are worried because the government is no longer promising to let the public see and comment on the new laws before they're introduced to parliament. A spokesperson for the Wilderness Society, Sam Szoke-Burke, said that the community played a big part in pushing for changes to environmental laws. Almost 30,000 people and organizations gave their opinions during a review of the current law by Graeme Samuel. But now, it seems like the community is being excluded from the process. Szoke-Burke said, \"No public consultations means that powerful groups will be able to do whatever they want without anyone watching. Only the elite and well-connected people will have a say.\"",

            "text": "Once upon a not-so-distant time, the growing season for the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Green Things Farm Collective followed a steadfast trajectory.  Related: \u2018Our world hangs by a thread\u2019: Indigenous activist asks US agri giant to stop destroying Amazon rainforest  \u201cWe reliably had rainy springs and early summers, then hot and dry in late July and August, with the rains picking up again in September,\u201d said Stacy Mates, Green Things\u2019 seed company manager. \u201cFor a crop like lettuce seed, it was perfect.\u201d Within this decade, Mates has noticed that the previously familiar cycle \u201chas changed dramatically. What we\u2019ve gotten the last three years is drought in June and then torrential rains in July and August,\u201d causing complete lettuce seed crop failures two years running. This year, after golf ball-sized hail, numerous severe thunderstorms and 75mph winds, a first crop of seed never matured. Mates treated a second crop with kid gloves, trellising the plants and covering them with shade cloth in hopes they\u2019d survive another deluge. By late September, Mates had managed a solid harvest, with enough seed to sell. Farmers are already fighting many battles in a growing season: beating back powdery mildew on cucumbers, hornworms devouring tomato leaves and strawberries plagued by verticillium rot. But for the farmers who grow the seeds that wind up in our seed packets and undergird our horticultural adventures, production has become ever more difficult. So difficult, in fact, that Green Things recently decided it would call it quits on growing for seeds. Mates can\u2019t say for certain just how much climate change is to blame for production challenges, only that its role is undeniable. \u201cWe are not having normal seasons any more\u201d, said Lane Selman, an agricultural researcher at Oregon State University and founder of a seed-producer community called the Culinary Breeding Network. As the northern hemisphere shakes off its hottest summer on record, intensifying weather events threaten the variety we take for granted when we page through winter-delivered seed catalogues, dreaming of a bountiful spring. Every seed company is facing these problems, but they probably wouldn\u2019t want to tell you that \u201cEvery seed company is facing these problems, but they probably wouldn\u2019t want to tell you that,\u201d said Alan Sparks, an industry veteran who consults for Baker Creek Seeds. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve got everything in control! Everything\u2019s gonna be OK!\u2019 But it\u2019s not OK.\u201d Green Things, which also grows vegetables, herbs and flowers, produced all the seeds in its catalogue. But many seed companies contract with individual farmers to grow at least some stock. One reason is that some crops need lots of space for a good yield. And not all seeds grow well everywhere. Furthermore, open-pollinated, non-hybrid seeds must be spaced sometimes miles apart \u2013 not just from similar varieties on that farm but on its neighbors\u2019 farms too \u2013 to avoid cross-pollination and ensure they grow true to type. On Mates\u2019 half-acre, she stopped growing carrots because they cross with a common weed, Queen Anne\u2019s lace. Seed farmers may grow hybrids or open-pollinated varieties; they do this in many locales, although Selman called the Pacific north-west \u201cone of the greatest places to grow seed in the world\u201d because of its (once) reliable weather. Some seed companies contract with farmers in Asia or India, for climatic and cost reasons. No matter where or how, it\u2019s harder to produce seeds than market-ready vegetables. Seed farmers \u201chave to be trained how to treat the soil, how to keep the plant healthy, when to harvest \u2026 And [seed is] a living product that you have to keep cool and dry\u201d when you store it, said Sparks. Poor-quality seeds may have lower germination rates or be more susceptible to disease. Plants grown for seed stay in the ground much longer than food crops. Growing cabbages to eat may require sowing in June and harvesting in October. \u201cBut that only represents a very small portion of a cabbage\u2019s lifecycle,\u201d said Nathaniel Talbot, who raises seed and vegetables at his Deep Harvest Farm on Whidbey Island, Washington. Open-pollinated  Open-pollinated seeds are pollinated naturally in the field, where they become adapted to local growing conditions over time. As long as they don\u2019t cross-pollinate with other varieties or species, they grow \u201ctrue to type\u201d \u2013 that is, with the same characteristics \u2013 every year.  Heirloom  Heirlooms are old varieties passed down for generations. All heirlooms are open-pollinated, although not all open-pollinated varieties are heirlooms.  Hybrid  People purposely cross pollen from one variety or species with another to get a third, called a hybrid. The goal may be drought tolerance or pest resistance. Hybrid seeds are considered vigorous, but they don\u2019t grow true to type a second year.  A seed cabbage overwinters in the ground and keeps growing the next spring. A biennial plant, cabbage takes two years to bolt \u2013 that is, elongate in preparation for flowering. After it\u2019s pollinated, the plant produces seed in a narrow pod that looks like a string bean; Talbot handpicks these pods, taps their seeds into a bucket after they\u2019ve dried on tarps, then arduously removes the chaff by hand. Seed to seed, the process can take 14 months. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more time involved [in raising seeds]. And with more extreme weather sprinkled through our lives, it\u2019s a lot more time for things to go wrong,\u201d said Brian Campbell, co-owner of Uprising Seeds in Bellingham, Washington. In 2021, a heat dome hit the Pacific north-west just as Campbell\u2019s cauliflower came into full bloom. The cauliflower survived, but its pollen withered from 100F temperatures. \u201cWe ended up getting no seed from that crop,\u201d he said. Jim Gerritsen is an organic farmer in Bridgewater, Maine. He grows 20-plus varieties of organic seed potatoes, for mail-order customers and seed companies like Southern Exposure. After several years of drought, extreme wet is now the problem \u2013 although Gerritsen\u2019s taken to chiseling up the soil ahead of planting to \u201cdivert rainwater into the subsoil away from the rhizosphere\u201d where his potatoes are rooting and growing, he said. Even if his spuds grow well, he still needs dry days for harvesting. \u201cYou dig on a Monday. Then on Tuesday, you get an inch of rain so you\u2019re not digging,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take Wednesday to dry out and then you get back in the field on Thursday; then you get another half inch rain on Friday. You\u2019re not digging on Saturday because the ground [needs to] dry out, so maybe you don\u2019t get back into the field until Monday. The harvest takes about 15 good days, but in a wet fall it takes [four or more] weeks to find 15 good days to dig in.\u201d With more extreme weather sprinkled through our lives, it\u2019s a lot more time for things to go wrong Seed work isn\u2019t finished after harvest, either. Broccoli seed, like cabbage seed, dries for a week before it\u2019s cleaned and placed in packets. Explained Culinary Breeding Network\u2019s Selman: \u201cDuring that dry down period, if the seeds get wet, you are completely screwed.\u201d An heirloom nasturtium offered by Baker Creek, called purple emperor, was developed by a Japanese seed company that for seven years selected plants that consistently produced purple flowers. The first 2.2lbs of seeds yielded another 55lbs in Holland; those were then sent to a farmer in Punjab, India, for bulk production. Recently, Sparks learned that the water table in this \u201cbreadbasket\u201d region of India is diminishing. On top of floods there in 2021 and a heatwave in 2022, in 2023 there was only a \u201c30% of harvest [of all seeds] for this growing area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be that in the next 10 years [no one is] able to grow there anymore.\u201d For large seed companies accustomed to adjusting locations, moving production to less temperamental locales may not be a daunting prospect \u2013 although Sparks said that training farmers to raise seed takes time and there\u2019s already a critical shortage of people to do the work. But no matter where they live, seed farmers themselves don\u2019t have the luxury of relocation. For them, the key to future resiliency is adaptation right where they are. For Mates of the Green Things Farm Collective, that means that more research into both open-pollinated and hybrid seeds is necessary for an uncertain future \u2013 and that especially holds true for small-scale and organic farmers. She said that farmers like her need seeds that are disease- and pest-resistant, grow in systems with few chemicals and little tilling, and survive a range of climate fluctuations. As climate change becomes more chaotic, we want plants with a resilient enough genetic makeup that they can survive if not thrive Hybrid varieties are bred for what\u2019s called \u201cvertical\u201d resistance, to one pest or disease; growers of open-pollinated varieties save seed from plants that have \u201chorizontal\u201d resistance, meaning they can withstand a variety of regional stressors. \u201cAs climate change becomes more chaotic \u2013 one year\u2019s drought might be another year\u2019s freeze \u2013 we want plants with a resilient enough genetic makeup that they can survive if not thrive in both of those situations,\u201d Talbot said. These tenets of open pollination \u201care part of the resilience you\u2019re talking about\u201d, said Selman. The biggest thing home gardeners purchasing seed can do to help is to \u201csupport local, small, regional seed companies so they don\u2019t go away because they are doing incredible work\u201d. ",

            "text": "Once upon a not-so-distant time, the Green Things Farm Collective in Ann Arbor, Michigan had a predictable growing season. They had rainy springs and early summers, followed by hot and dry weather in late July and August, and then more rain in September. This was perfect for growing lettuce seeds. But things have changed in the past decade. Now, they face drought in June and heavy rains in July and August, which has caused their lettuce seed crops to fail for the past two years. This year, they faced hail, severe thunderstorms, and strong winds, which prevented their first crop of seeds from maturing. They managed to harvest a second crop, but it was a challenging process.\n\nClimate change is making it harder for farmers to grow seeds. Lane Selman, an agricultural researcher at Oregon State University, said that they are not experiencing normal seasons anymore. This is a problem for all seed companies, although they may not openly admit it. Seed companies often contract with individual farmers to grow their stock because some crops require a lot of space for a good yield, and not all seeds grow well in every location. Open-pollinated seeds, which are naturally pollinated in the field, need to be spaced far apart to avoid cross-pollination. This ensures that they grow true to type. Seed farmers also have to be trained in soil treatment, plant health, and proper storage to maintain the quality of the seeds.\n\nExtreme weather events are becoming more common, causing difficulties for seed farmers. Brian Campbell, co-owner of Uprising Seeds, lost his cauliflower crop due to a heatwave in 2021. Jim Gerritsen, an organic farmer in Maine, has faced drought followed by extreme wetness, which makes it challenging to harvest his seed potatoes. Seed work is not finished after harvest either. Seeds need to be dried and cleaned properly to ensure their quality. Any moisture during this process can ruin the seeds.\n\nClimate change is also affecting seed production in other parts of the world. A farmer in Punjab, India, experienced a diminishing water table, floods, and a heatwave, resulting in a 30% harvest of all seeds in the region. This raises concerns about the future of seed production in that area. Large seed companies may be able to adjust their production locations, but training farmers and finding enough people to do the work is already a challenge.\n\nTo adapt to these changing conditions, farmers like Stacy Mates of the Green Things Farm Collective believe that more research into both open-pollinated and hybrid seeds is necessary. They need seeds that are disease-resistant, can be grown with minimal chemicals and tilling, and can survive varying climate conditions. Hybrid seeds are bred to resist specific pests or diseases, while open-pollinated seeds have the ability to withstand a range of regional stressors. Supporting local, small, and regional seed companies is crucial to ensure their survival and the availability of resilient seeds.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is making it harder for seed farmers to grow crops. Extreme weather events, unpredictable seasons, and changing conditions are affecting seed production. Farmers and seed companies need to adapt and invest in research to develop seeds that can withstand these challenges. Supporting local seed companies is essential for a resilient future.",

Spring\u2019s succulent grasses have been supplanted by scruffier dock leaves, thistles and nettles. Berries on the trees and the reddening of leaves show that autumn is waiting backstage. We are exploring the delights of faeces and the little ecosystems inside them. Cowpats are the obvious choice because of their abundance, and they are also the least offensive on offer. Prof Ed Turner, curator of insects at Cambridge University, digs into one with a teaspoon. Rather like an episode of The Great British Bake Off, he is talking us through textures and ingredients. This one is a good bake. The mound of undigested food has probably been there for a couple of weeks, a mixture of faeces and urine lightly roasted by the summer sun. The outside is crispy but it\u2019s still moist inside. Wiry white-yellow grasses that look like they have been electrocuted are growing out of the top. Cow dung contains 24 minerals \u2013 including nitrogen, potassium, sulphur, iron, magnesium, copper, cobalt and manganese \u2013 as well as a rich diversity of bacteria and fungi. \u201cThere is a whole suite of animals that feed on this,\u201d says Turner. This is a nursery for new life. We quickly find a juicy, translucent dung beetle larva, gorging itself on poo, in what looks like a semi-conscious stupor. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s folded over \u2013 that\u2019s a classic shape,\u201d says Turner. There are up to 20 more larvae, and others will have burrowed underground. Each has its own little sleeping cabin, connected with tunnels. They live in complete darkness, and squirm when exposed to the sun. The UK is home to more than 60 species of dung beetle. I tell a passing walker we are studying cow dung and she says her dog would like to help us, though she wouldn\u2019t We also find rove beetles, mites, springtails, ants, spiders and earthworms. Birds and mammals also come to feast on the cowpats. Turner describes it as \u201chooching with life\u201d. He says: \u201cThirty or 40 people have walked past this morning and have no idea these animals are here.\u201d I tell a passing walker that we are studying cow dung and she says her dog would like to help us, though she wouldn\u2019t. The creatures living on the cowpats are providing us with a great service. These decomposers play a critical role in breaking down organic matter, taking it into the soil and making it available for plants and other creatures. Without nature\u2019s recyclers, our planet would be awash with dung. Research suggests that dung beetles may save the UK cattle industry more than \u00a340m a year through their ability to remove faeces, increase soil nutrients and reduce the number of flies. All around us, mammals\u2019 faeces is providing food for a range of animals. These cows are unmedicated (meaning the dung is chemical-free), making it particularly attractive to invertebrates. Because of this, it is processed and removed faster than that of medicated animals. Turner says: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got more species, you get an enhanced ecosystem function, which basically in this case is dung removal. \u201cThe more species you\u2019ve got, the faster that function is \u2013 this is a tiny example of that,\u201d he says.  Related: Secrets of the deadwood: ancient oaks hold key to new life  Faeces have a long legacy. Along the path are tufts of longer grasses, which are the ghosts of previous cow dung. This succession is already happening in the dung we have excavated \u2013 around the edge is a ring of longer, darker grass that has benefited from the nutrients being absorbed into the soil. Turner calls this the halo effect. It is an indication of the nourishment faeces can give soil when left in moderation. Carcasses and deadwood \u2013 also full of dead and decaying matter \u2013 do a similar thing, forming the basis of rich habitats. Yet many consider deadwood, animal carcasses and faeces to be unsightly, or just waste. There can be more than 280 invertebrates in one large handful of rotten wood inside a tree, yet it is often cleared away to make things more \u201ctidy\u201d. In a natural woodland, a quarter of wood is dead, but in most woodland managed by humans, it is less than 10%, according to the Wildlife Trusts. In the same way, cow dung is seen as unsightly. In 2021, Turner was part of the Cowpats About Cambridge campaign, inviting people to send in photos of beetles found in dung. How many people sent in pictures? \u201cNot that many, actually,\u201d he admits. I ask how many times he has come out here and found people inspecting poo. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d  Turner wants us to get out and look at everyday wildlife, even if they are wood pigeons and magpies (which seem to be doing well in this meadow). This includes digging into cowpats or turning over old logs. If people are not curious about these ordinary things, conservation is dead, he says. \u201cUltimately, [common] things like that can help protect rare things as well, because when people get engaged in wildlife, it\u2019s addictive,\u201d he says. The starter kit is simple. \u201cAll you need is a spoon,\u201d says Turner. \u201cMake sure you wash it afterwards.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features ",

The fresh grass from spring has been replaced by scruffier leaves, thistles, and nettles. The berries on the trees and the changing color of the leaves show that autumn is on its way. Right now, we're going to explore something interesting: poop and the tiny ecosystems inside it. We're focusing on cow poop because there's a lot of it, and it's not as gross as some other options. Prof Ed Turner, who studies bugs at Cambridge University, is showing us what's inside a cowpat. It's a bit like watching a cooking show, where he describes the textures and ingredients. This particular cowpat is well-baked. It's a mound of undigested food that has probably been there for a few weeks. The summer sun has lightly roasted it, so the outside is crispy, but the inside is still moist. There are wiry grasses growing out of the top that look like they've been electrocuted.

Turner says it's like a party of life happening on the poop. He says, \"Lots of people have walked past this morning and have no idea these animals are here.\" I tell another person that we're studying cow poop, and she jokes that her dog would love to help too. The creatures living on the cowpats are doing us a big favor. They're decomposers, which means they break down the poop and turn it into nutrients for the soil. Without them, there would be poop everywhere! Research suggests that dung beetles save the UK cattle industry over \u00a340m a year by getting rid of poop, adding nutrients to the soil, and reducing the number of flies. All around us, poop from other animals is also providing food for different creatures. These cows don't take any medication, so their poop is free from chemicals. That makes it even more attractive to insects. Because of this, their poop gets processed and removed from the meadow faster than poop from medicated animals. Turner explains, \"When you have more species, you get a better ecosystem. This is a small example of that.\" Poop has a long-lasting effect. Along the path, there are patches of taller grass, which are leftover from previous cowpats. We can already see this happening with the cowpat we're studying. There's a ring of longer, darker grass around it that has benefited from the nutrients in the soil. Turner calls it the halo effect. It shows how poop can help the soil in small amounts. Dead animals, deadwood, and poop are usually seen as ugly or just waste. But they're actually important for creating rich habitats. For example, there can be more than 280 different bugs in a handful of rotten wood inside a tree. But often, this wood gets cleared away to make things tidier. In a natural woodland, a quarter of the wood is dead, but in most woodlands managed by people, it's less than 10%. The same goes for cow poop.

This includes digging into poop or turning over old logs. He says that if people aren't curious about these everyday things, conservation efforts won't succeed. \"When people get interested in everyday wildlife, it can also help protect rare things because it becomes addictive,\" he explains.

The tornadoes produced wind gusts of 115mph and 125mph respectively, according to the US National Weather Service, making them EF-2 tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale. This scale is used to classify a tornado based on the wind gusts measured over a 3-second period, with EF-0 being the lowest and EF-5 being the highest. An EF-0 tornado has wind gusts of 65-80mph, with wind gusts exceeding 200mph in an EF-5 tornado. No injuries were reported after the Florida EF-2s. Meanwhile, unusually windy conditions are forecast to develop across the North Sea later this week as areas of low pressure push northwards across France, through the Channel and towards the UK and Ireland. By Thursday and Friday, gusts of 70-80mph are possible in the North Sea bringing large waves and potential disruption. Wave heights of more than 7 metres are possible between Norway and Scotland. Strong winds are also likely to affect eastern Scotland and many eastern counties of England, with an increased risk of some damage to trees. The winds will be from an east to south-easterly direction as opposed to the usual south-westerly direction that prevails across north-west Europe. A blocking area of high pressure located across Scandinavia will be responsible for the development of these strong winds as areas of low pressure moving in from the Atlantic struggle to make progress eastwards.

            "text": "A solar-powered car said to be the first in the world capable of driving off-road over long distances without recharging has completed a 620-mile (1,000km) test drive across Morocco and the Sahara. The two-seat Stella Terra, designed by students at the Eindhoven University of Technology, completed the journey across a variety of challenging landscapes as part of a final test of its lightweight frame and aerodynamic profile. The car, which runs off the energy provided by multiple solar panels on its roof, has a top speed of 90mph (145kmph), weighs only 1,200kg (1.2 tonnes) and has a range of at least 440 miles (710km) on a sunny day. Wisse Bos, team manager of Solar Team Eindhoven, said the technology used, complementing a lightweight frame with highly efficient solar panels, was a decade ahead of anything on the market. He said: \u201cStella Terra must withstand the harsh conditions of off-roading while remaining efficient and light enough to be powered by the sun. That is why we had to design almost everything for Stella Terra ourselves, from the suspension to the inverters for the solar panels. We are pushing the boundaries of technology.\u201d The car contains a rechargeable lithium (Li)-ion battery, which would also allow it to operate in less sunny climates but over shorter distances. Such is the level of energy provided by the solar panels on the car that it can provide sufficient electricity for cooking and charging devices such as a phone or camera. Aged between 21 and 25, the 22 students behind the car brought the project to life after taking a year off from their studies. The steering system on the olive-green car failed during the week-and-a-half-long experiment in the dry and varied landscapes of north Africa, from Tangier to the Sahara, but it was swiftly put right, according to Bob van Ginkel, 24, the project\u2019s technical manager. He said: \u201cWe hope this can be an inspiration to car manufacturers such as Land Rover and BMW to make it a more sustainable industry. The car was actually very comfortable in the off-road conditions as it is very light and does not get stuck.\u201d The car\u2019s bespoke converter was found to be 97% efficient in turning sunlight absorbed by the solar panels into electrical charge. Stella Terra was a third more efficient than had been originally envisioned. The most efficient panels on the market generally reach about 45% efficiency, while most panels are about 15% to 20% efficient. Britt van Hulst, 21, the project\u2019s finance manager, said there remained further work to do before the design could go to market but that it offered an avenue for large automobile manufacturers to explore. The largest challenge for designers seeking to build solar-powered cars is the limited surface area on which to locate panels. Highly efficient panels able to generate sufficient energy to power vehicles over a long distance are expensive to produce. The Stella Terra team is not for profit and had relied on sponsors for its budget. A spokesperson said it was not able to provide a total cost for the project. The manufacturing cost appears to have been an inhibiting factor in the latest attempt to break into the automotive market by Atlas Technologies, a subsidiary of the Netherlands-based Lightyear. The company was intending last year to produce solar-electric cars, which had been due to retail at \u20ac500,000, but the firm announced its bankruptcy after a lack of orders. The company has since reemerged with a new model that would cost $40,000 a vehicle and be able to travel about 500 miles between charges. ",

Overall the number of designated local green spaces has increased by more than 700 in the past 12 months.

Related: \u2018We\u2019re a thorn in their side\u2019: the battle over green space in London\u2019s estates  Brad Taylor, lead author on the report, said: \u201cCommunities with high levels of deprivation need to have their voices heard and their local green spaces protected.\u201d He said people must be empowered to engage in the local and neighbourhood planning process that can secure official local green space designations, which mean the land cannot be built upon.  Related: Two-hour \u2018dose\u2019 of nature significantly boosts health\u00a0\u2013 study  There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of access to green spaces not just for wildlife and biodiversity, but for a host of physical and mental health benefits. Green spaces also help protect against flooding and heatwaves. Local green space (LGS) designations were introduced in 2012 to give green belt-like protections to smaller areas of land that are often identified by communities themselves. Since then, 7,286 LGS areas have been established for reasons including their recreational value, beauty and importance for wildlife. Today\u2019s report found that 711 new local green spaces have been designated since 2022, the majority in northern England. In London, the total number grew by 64%. But while designations have increased in deprived areas, CPRE mapping reveals that a strong correlation persists between deprivation and lack of green space. The study looked at four areas in detail: \u2022 Blackpool, which has high levels of deprivation and no LGS designations. \u2022 Hull, one of the few local authorities with no LGS designations despite having many green spaces. \u2022 Shropshire, where LGS designations for school playing fields have played a part in rejuvenating rural areas and providing young people with much-needed opportunities to socialise. \u2022 London, where a community garden designated as an LGS has boosted academic performance and enabled young people to connect with nature. CPRE is calling for the LGS designation process to be standardised to make it easier for communities to make use of the legislation. Taylor said: \u201cOur green spaces are there for everyone to enjoy \u2013 everyone needs to be involved in deciding how to protect them.\u201d ",

In an interview with Guardian Seascape, she added that artists were often the \u201ccanaries in the coalmine\u201d of environmental emergencies because it was their job to be sensitive. The song, a collaboration with the Catalan pop star Rosal\u00eda, is based on a recording Bj\u00f6rk made two decades ago and only rediscovered in March. The pair will donate the proceeds to activists who oppose industrial salmon farming in Iceland, currently in the spotlight after revelations of repeated escapes of thousands of fish into the wild. Bj\u00f6rk said the rediscovered song sounded \u201cstrange\u201d, noting it was recorded about 20 years ago when she was in her mid-30s. \u201cI was like, whoa, OK \u2013 the beat in it was very primitive, but I guess I was sort of slightly inspired by dancehall from Jamaica.\u201d Thinking she could use it to benefit the environment, \u201cwhere my heart is\u201d, she said, she asked Rosal\u00eda to help her update it for a contemporary audience, with production by the Irish-Scottish producer Sega Bodega. \u201cThe way to reactivate the song for an environmental platform in 2023 would be to get a guest that represents the moment,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk said of her thinking. \u201cDancehall is the grandmother of reggaeton. When I heard it, I thought: Rosal\u00eda had a lot of reggaeton on her album. I know she really cares and wants to act. I think she was excited about it because she wants to do something about the environment.\u201d Artists often ended up as environmentalists because, Bj\u00f6rk said, \u201cwe are the canary in the coalmine. It\u2019s our job to have our sensors, our antennae, out all the time, and read how we feel in our environment and be aware. We pick up this emergency \u2013 and we want to act on it.\u201d In a statement on Instagram about the collaboration, Bj\u00f6rk wrote: \u201cPeople at the fjord Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur have stood up and protested against fish farming starting there. We would like to donate sales of the song to help with their legal fees and hopefully it can be an exemplary case for others.\u201d Bj\u00f6rk claimed this industrial farming of salmon \u201chas already had a devastating effect on wildlife and the farmed fish are suffering in horrid health conditions. And since a lot of them have escaped, they have started changing the DNA in the Icelandic salmon for the worse, and could eventually lead to its extinction.\u201d But, she emphasised to the Guardian, the song itself was not a protest. \u201cIt is not an activist song,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a love song. It\u2019s not about fish.\u201d She paused. \u201cAlthough you could write a good punk song about that.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is not me at my most experimental. I\u2019m not really a pop musician. That\u2019s sort of why it never made it on [past albums] Homogenic or Vespertine. It was kind of too much sugar. This is as poppy as I\u2019ll ever get. That is why I wanted to give it to a good cause.\u201d The promotional materials for the song are also in Spanish, with the hopes that \u201cother places could follow\u201d, she said. \u201cRosal\u00eda was telling me in Argentina and Chile [fish farming] is a disaster.\u201d  Bj\u00f6rk said she asked herself three questions before deciding to support the movement. \u201cCan we stop it? Can we change it? Can we save the wild salmon of Iceland? The answer to all these three questions is yes, we can.\u201d She noted that sentiment against salmon farming in Iceland had united the left and right, and she described the industry as \u201ca couple of wild guys who want to make money quick and sacrifice nature\u201d. Bj\u00f6rk has a history of environmental activism, once shelving a gig at the Icelandic Airwaves festival to demonstrate against plans to build 50 dams and hydropower plants. David Attenborough recorded a message to explain the concept of \u201cbiophilia\u201d for an app she released to accompany her album of that name, and in 2019 the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg recorded a message for Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Cornucopia tour. The same year, Bj\u00f6rk and Thunberg encouraged the Icelandic prime minister to declare a climate emergency \u2013 and when Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir didn\u2019t, Bj\u00f6rk accused her in a Guardian interview last year of going back on her word, saying: \u201cI was so pissed off because I had been planning that for months.\u201d In 2008, Bj\u00f6rk released a song, N\u00e1tt\u00fara, featuring Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke, from which all proceeds went to the N\u00e1tt\u00fara campaign, an environmental group she co-founded to fight the construction of foreign-backed aluminium factories in Iceland. The singer\u2019s mother, Hildur R\u00fana Hauksd\u00f3ttir, who died in 2018 after a long illness, also campaigned against the factories and in 2002 went on hunger strike for 23 days to protest. \u201cWe are guardians,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk concluded. \u201cWe want to protect nature.\u201d ",

            "text": "The increasing popularity of ultra-heavy SUVs in England means a conventional-engined car bought in 2013 will, on average, have lower carbon emissions than one bought new today, new research has found. The study by the climate campaign group Possible said there was a strong correlation between income and owning a large SUV, which meant there was a sound argument for \u201cpolluter pays\u201d taxes for vehicle emissions based on size. Data on vehicle ownership in England showed that households in the top 20% income bracket are 81% more likely to own a highly emitting car than vehicle owners in the other 80%. The top 20% income group drive three times as many miles a year as those in the bottom income quintile. The study found the carbon impact of the richest people\u2019s driving habits to have damaged the climate more than \u201cthose of the poorest\u201d. Car ownership data in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea found having an SUV was associated with living in a richer area, more so for super-heavy, high-emitting cars such as the Land Rover Defender. Nearly a quarter of the cars in the wealthiest part of the borough fell into this category, against 5% for the more deprived part. The research comes amid increasing concern about the environmental, health and safety impact of the increasing popularity of SUVs, often very large four-wheel drive vehicles that can routinely weigh more than two tonnes. While the definition of an SUV can vary, the proportion of cars sold in the UK that come under the banner has risen in recent years from about a fifth to almost a third. While they are billed as vehicles that cover rough ground or tow heavy loads, previous research has shown that three-quarters of SUVs bought new in the UK are registered to people living in urban areas. The effect of rising sales of SUVs, and the fact they tend to be notably heavier than the traditional models previously bought, means the average conventional-engined car bought in 2023 has higher carbon emissions than its 2013 equivalent, the study calculated. The report called for a distinction between drivers being charged based on greenhouse gas emissions rather than for emissions with direct public health effects, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx). Recent debate over London\u2019s expanded ultra-low emission zone has focused on concerns that cars that emit more NOx are almost always older, and disproportionately used by less wealthy people. In contrast, the report argued, high greenhouse emissions have often been a product of richer people buying huge SUVs \u2013 at a price that showed they could afford an electric car. The authors said there was also a social justice argument for carbon-emissions based parking and road user charging. Lambeth, in south London, charges owners of the heaviest, most high-emission vehicles, more than four times as much for an annual parking permit than for the smallest cars. A similar scheme in Kensington and Chelsea has a differential of up to 10 times. Other councils should follow, Possible said: \u201cThe Chelsea tractor has launched an assault on the future, and if we don\u2019t fight back fast, we will all find ourselves under its wheels.\u201d SUVs are even more prevalent in some other countries, accounting for about half of all sales in the US. This year, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said that, globally, SUVs produced emissions equivalent to the combined national totals of the UK and Germany. In the US, there has been a separate focus on the safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists from SUVs, particularly ultra-large \u201ctrucks\u201d. After decades of decline, US pedestrian deaths have begun rising again, and are now at 7,500 a year, the highest level since 1981. ",

            "text": "A new study has found that the popularity of big, heavy SUVs in England is causing a problem with carbon emissions. The research by a group called Possible discovered that a car bought in 2013, which had a regular engine, actually produced less carbon emissions on average than a new car bought today. The study also found that people with higher incomes were more likely to own a large SUV, which is a type of vehicle that can be very heavy and produce a lot of emissions. The research showed that the wealthiest 20% of people in England are 81% more likely to own a high-emitting car compared to the other 80%. These rich people also drive three times as many miles per year as people with lower incomes. The study concluded that the carbon emissions from the driving habits of rich people have had a worse impact on the climate than those of poorer people. The research also looked at car ownership in a part of London called Kensington and Chelsea. It found that living in a richer area was linked to owning an SUV, especially a very heavy one like the Land Rover Defender. In the wealthiest part of that area, nearly a quarter of cars were SUVs, whereas in the poorer part, only 5% were SUVs. This study comes at a time when more and more people are worried about the effect of SUVs on the environment, health, and safety. SUVs are large, four-wheel drive vehicles that can weigh more than two tonnes. In recent years, the proportion of cars sold in the UK that are SUVs has gone up from about one-fifth to almost one-third. Despite being marketed as vehicles for rough terrain or heavy loads, research has shown that three-quarters of new SUVs in the UK are actually bought by people who live in cities. This increase in sales of SUVs, along with the fact that they are generally heavier than older models, means that the average car with a regular engine bought in 2023 produces more carbon emissions than the same type of car bought in 2013, according to the study. The report suggests that drivers should be charged based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions their cars produce, rather than for emissions that directly affect public health, like nitrogen oxides. There has been a recent debate in London about the expanded ultra-low emission zone, with concerns that cars emitting more nitrogen oxides are usually older and used more by people with lower incomes. On the other hand, the report argues that richer people buying huge SUVs are responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions, even though they can afford to buy electric cars. The authors of the report also say that charging for parking and road use should be based on carbon emissions, as it is a matter of social justice. For example, in a part of London called Lambeth, owners of the heaviest, most high-emission vehicles are charged more than four times the amount for an annual parking permit compared to owners of the smallest cars. A similar scheme in Kensington and Chelsea has a difference of up to 10 times. Possible, the group behind the study, says that other councils should do the same and introduce these types of schemes. They believe that if we don't act quickly, the popularity of SUVs will harm our future. SUVs are very popular in other countries as well, with about half of all car sales in the US being SUVs. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency based in Paris said that globally, SUVs produce emissions that are equivalent to the combined emissions of the UK and Germany. In the US, there is also a concern about the safety of pedestrians and cyclists because of SUVs, especially the very large ones called \"trucks\". After a long period of decreasing numbers, the US has seen an increase in pedestrian deaths, with 7,500 recorded each year. This is the highest level since 1981.",

            "text": "Autumn on Orkney is an understated affair. There are very few trees, so there\u2019s no fiery foliage for us. Instead, it is a season marked by sideways rain, sodden fields and cancelled ferries. The mud starts now, and only deepens as the months go on. At the stables, there is a flurry of activity as we rush to get the heavyweight rugs ready for use: fishing them out of musty lockers and shaking off the worst of last year\u2019s mud, hosing them down, reapplying waterproof sprays. This week is clipping week, an annual affair when the yard is abuzz with electric shears and wind-blown clumps of hair in brown, grey, black and dun tumble down the aisle and gather like leaves in damp corners. The horses\u2019 winter coats came in almost overnight. One moment they were as sleek and shining as conkers, the next they were fluffy hill ponies lathering with sweat every time they broke into a trot. All this extra hair is excellent all\u2011weather insulation, but it causes problems for horses in regular exercise. Those in light work can be relieved with a neat little \u201cbib\u201d clip, wherein the hair is cut away in a band from throat to breast. Busier horses will need something more businesslike, a \u201ctrace\u201d clip, for example, where the neck and belly are trimmed away, leaving backs and loins hairy. Robbie, my Connemara, has a full clip, but we leave the hair on his legs as protection from the elements and rub oil into his hair at intervals to stop mud from irritating the skin. (\u201cMud fever\u201d, an uncomfortable form of dermatitis, can arise in prologued wet conditions.) But clipped horses need to be rugged, especially when they\u2019re out in wild island gales. So here we are: spraying, mending, patching, getting things in order. I have mixed feelings. Autumn meets a return to cold feet, wet leather, riding in the dark. But it also means haynets, straw beds, warming hands under rugs. When I turn Robbie out, I find his field mates huddled in the shelter, tightly packed and unusually cordial disputes settled until spring, or until the sun comes out at least.

We have to take them out of smelly lockers and shake off last year's mud, then hose them down and spray them with waterproof stuff. This week is \"clipping week,\" when we use electric shears to cut the horses' hair. The hair falls down like leaves in the aisles of the stable. The horses suddenly grow a lot more hair, which helps keep them warm in all kinds of weather. But it can cause problems when they exercise. Horses that do less work can have a small clip in the front, where the hair is taken off. Horses that work more need a bigger clip, where the hair on the neck and belly is taken off. My horse, Robbie, gets a full clip, but we leave the hair on his legs for protection and put oil on his hair to keep the mud from bothering his skin.

            "text": "Water metering should be made compulsory for all households in England, the government is likely to be told this week, as water supplies come under pressure from increased demand and more frequent droughts and floods. Strain on the UK\u2019s water networks is increasing under the more extreme weather conditions generated by the climate crisis and, under increasing demand, investment by water companies has not kept up. No new large reservoirs have been constructed in England in at least 30 years, and leaks from pipes still amount to about a third of water wasted. Managing demand through metering is therefore unavoidable, a panel of independent experts convened by the government is likely to find. The National Infrastructure Commission will publish its comprehensive assessment of the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure, the first for five years, on Wednesday. Covering everything from energy and transport to water and waste, it is expected to find large gaps in investment and many areas in which the UK\u2019s existing infrastructure is poorly maintained and inadequate. The commission, set up under George Osborne when he was chancellor of the exchequer with the aim of advising government on vital investment, is also likely to warn that the UK is falling behind on the infrastructure needed to meet the legally binding goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to protect against the probable impacts of the climate crisis. Many of the commission\u2019s findings are likely to be controversial, particularly in light of recent government announcements. The cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 has thrown out plans for public transport across the north of England, and delays to the phase-out of gas boilers have implications for gas use and energy needs for decades. Water is likely to be one of the most hotly contested issues. Sewage in rivers has provoked widespread public anger and, although few people have yet experienced problems with their water supply, that too is likely to start happening, as water supplies are not keeping pace with demand. Water companies have extracted about \u00a372bn in dividends since privatisation, but are asking for investment of about \u00a396bn to alleviate the sewage crisis and safeguard supplies. Most or all of that will have to come from billpayers under the current system. The commission is likely to find that up to nine new large reservoirs are needed, as well as enlargement of some existing reservoirs, and a plethora of water recycling plants. Nine new desalination plants could also be necessary. Increases in supply are unlikely to solve the problem on their own as the climate crisis gets worse and droughts and floods become more common across the UK. Managing demand will therefore be necessary, and compulsory water metering is viewed as the best means of achieving that. Water metering has been controversial in the past, as social campaigners have raised concerns over the impacts on large families on low incomes. However, water companies could be empowered to offer a range of tariffs that would mean large households, or households with special needs, could afford their bills. Water metering would also ensure that people on high incomes who use outsize quantities of water for leisure purposes were fairly charged. At present, people with large water usage, such as for big gardens or swimming pools \u2013 including the prime minister, Rishi Sunak \u2013 are able to use as much water as they wish, without having to install compulsory meters. Downing Street did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s question of whether Sunak had a water meter installed with his swimming pool at his home in North Yorkshire. The pool required an upgrade to the local electricity grid, with the cost paid by the prime minister, the Guardian revealed earlier this year. Government intervention will be required to install compulsory meters, as in many areas water companies lack the powers to install them, outside areas judged to be under water stress. A legally binding target is already in place to reduce water consumption by 20% a person by 2038, falling further by 2050, from about 145 litres a day to 110. The National Infrastructure Commission has hinted in the past that more water metering would be needed, though it has previously stopped short of making it an official recommendation. Sir John Armitt, chair of the commission, said as drought gathered pace last summer that he viewed water metering as a necessary step. ",

About a third of water is wasted due to leaks from pipes. The government has asked a group of experts to look into this issue, and they are likely to find that metering water usage is necessary to manage the demand.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Infrastructure Commission will release a report on the UK's critical infrastructure. It will cover things like energy, transportation, water, and waste. The report is expected to show that there are gaps in investment and that the existing infrastructure is not well-maintained or sufficient. The commission will also likely warn that the UK is not keeping up with the infrastructure needed to reach the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to protect against the effects of the climate crisis.\n\nThe report may bring up some controversial findings, especially considering recent government announcements. The cancellation of the northern part of the HS2 project has affected plans for public transportation in the north of England, and delays in getting rid of gas boilers have implications for gas use and energy needs in the future. Water is also likely to be a contentious issue. People are angry about sewage in rivers, and there may soon be problems with water supply as well since it's not meeting the demand. Water companies have made \u00a372 billion in profits since they were privatized, but they are now asking for \u00a396 billion in investment to fix the sewage crisis and ensure enough water supply.

The marine biologist and her colleagues had an unusual destination in their sights: a disused oil platform that loomed ahead like a forgotten skyscraper reaching up from the horizon. The team wasn\u2019t interested in the platform itself, but what lurked beneath. When they reached the ageing structure, named Holly, they lowered a car-sized remote- controlled vehicle under the waves. There, they saw hundreds of thousands of juvenile rockfish finding shelter amid the hulking metal structure, alongside waving white anemones, clusters of mussels, and silver jack mackerel. The seasoned marine biologists have been observing this remarkable spectacle for years. Holly, which was put out of use in 2015, is one of 27 oil rigs built off the coast of California decades ago that have become hotbeds of biological activity. While not natural structures, their platforms have been embedded into the muddy seabed long enough to become part of the ocean environment, providing a home for creatures like mussels and barnacles, which in turn attract larger fish and sea lions that find safety and food there. After two and a half decades of studying the rigs, Bull says it\u2019s clear to her: \u201cThese places are extremely productive, both for commercial and recreational fisheries and for invertebrates.\u201d  Related: Parties, jetskis, second homes: how tourism threatens one of the world\u2019s only bioluminescent bays  Now, as California and the US shift away from offshore drilling and toward greener energy, a debate is mounting over their future. On one side are those who argue disused rigs are an environmental blight and should be removed entirely. On the other side are people, many of them scientists, who say we should embrace these accidental oases and that removing the structures is morally wrong. In other parts of the world, oil rigs have successfully become artificial reefs, in a policy known as rigs to reefs. For Milton Love, a scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was on the boat with Bull, it\u2019s a matter of ethics. He first encountered the rigs as an undergraduate student in the late 1960s when he was working as a commercial fisherman and collected fish off the rigs for a public aquarium, just as the platforms started to be installed. \u201cThere were a lot of fish,\u201d he says. \u201cThat stuck in my mind.\u201d When he returned to the platforms as a professor years later, Love was initially surprised to find highly diverse communities of fish at each rig. Sites closer to shore had more surfperch, while rigs further out had more ocean fish. He also started to feel uneasy about how the creatures were being discussed. \u201cIt kind of crept up on me at some point that removing these things is immoral.\u201d The fish don\u2019t know they are complicit in a fossil fuel infrastructure that is causing a climate crisis \u2013 they just see a hard structure and invertebrates attached to it, and a place to hide. Bull agrees. \u201cIf you take away habitat, then there\u2019s no going back,\u201dshe says. \u201cYou would never allow the willful destruction of a kelp bed, or of a rocky reef, even though rigs have similar biodiversity.\u201d Life tends to find a way, as they say \u2013 especially in the ocean. Drop a tire off a boat on the coast, Love says, and within a month there will be a species like the brown rockfish living in it, darting in and out of the rubber. The same is true of the rigs. California\u2019s oil rigs were built between 1967 and 1989, and many are now nearing the end of their fossil fuel lives \u2013 of the 27 that were built, only 15 are still pumping. Once the metal structures were installed in the sea bed, they were probably populated quickly by tiny plankton floating around in search of something to hold on to. Then a succession of creatures joined them: barnacles first, which got crowded out by mussels. Within months, fish were living in the rig structures \u2013 the lattice metal is an ideal structure to hide in, better than sand, where they are completely exposed to predation. Within a year or two, an entire ecosystem sprung up. \u201cNature does abhor a vacuum,\u201d Love says, \u201cwhich is the reason that on a platform, every square inch is covered in life.\u201d Two decades after first encountering the rigs, Love was back at UC Santa Barbara working as a marine biologist, and he realized there was almost no scientific research on oil rigs and fish abundance. What he and Bull discovered - both in terms of the variety of sea life and how the rigs are used by animals - has been astounding. Love, Bull and other colleagues have dived, used submarines and remotely operated vehicles to study what lives there, and they estimate there are probably billions of creatures \u2013 from barnacles to mammals \u2013 that rely on the rigs for habitat. According to a 2014 study they co-authored, the rigs were some of the most \u201cproductive\u201d ocean habitats in the world, a term that refers to biomass \u2013 or number of fish and how much space they take up \u2013 per unit area. The research showed the rigs to be about 27 times more productive than the natural rocky reefs in California. Jeremy Claisse, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona who co-authored the study with Love and Bull, said: \u201cIn college and grad school, you always read about how productive coral reef ecosystems and these estuary ecosystems are, and to do the math and find out these are as productive for fishes as those systems \u2013 that was pretty surprising.\u201d Subsequent studies showed that some species of rockfish produce 10 to 100 times more eggs and larvae at these platforms than at natural reefs. That\u2019s partly because many big adult fish are being caught by fishers at natural rocky reefs, but less so at rigs, where they have more protection. In some cases, the platforms are actually important to the populations of fish as a whole. In 2000, Love found that in the slow-growing rockfish bocaccio, a commercially important but overfished species, the rigs were home to one-fifth of the average number of juvenile fish that survive each year. Another study Love co-authored in 2012 tagged lingcod and rockfish and moved them to similar habitat on a natural reef across the Santa Barbara Channel to a protected area of Anacapa Island. Of the fish that were relocated, 25% of them swam back to their homes at the rig, travelling more than seven miles. Some returned in just 10 hours. California was home to the first offshore oil platform in the US, built in 1896 on a pier in the very same waters off Santa Barbara county where the rigs\u2019 future is disputed. The debate over what comes next for these vestiges of the oil industry is not unique to the state. Other parts of the world have successfully removed rigs completely \u2013 or turned them into artificial reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico, where the rigs sit in much shallower waters, at least 573 platforms have been declared artificial reefs by the government. Some of them have even been incorporated into national marine sanctuaries. The same could be done here, although the technical and legal landscape is trickier. The rigs are submerged in 800 to 1,000ft of water \u2013 a depth that has never been decommissioned before \u2013 and would require explosives to dislodge them from the seabed, then huge cranes and cargo ships to remove them. It\u2019s costly in terms of carbon footprint but also in dollars: the most recent estimate for removing all platforms off of the California coast totals $8bn, according to Bull. In 2010, the then governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, began allowing oil companies to turn their platforms into artificial reefs, then donate the cost saved by not having to remove the rigs entirely to a state conservation fund. For Emily Hazelwood, a marine conservation biologist and offshore energy consultant who consults on rigs to reefs projects, the idea is win-win-win: \u201cThe state wins by getting an endowment, the environment wins because the reefs get to stay, and the oil and gas companies also win by saving money.\u201d But environmental groups don\u2019t see a win. They cite the visual pollution of rigs on the ocean horizon and say that the plan lets fossil fuel companies escape paying for the end of life of their dirty products. Some called the plan \u201crigs to grief\u201d. Linda Krop, chief counsel of the non-profit Environmental Defense Center, says her group has been involved in the issue of rigs since 1996, when Chevron was required to remove four platforms. The company did, but it left behind piles of junk on the ocean floor in the form of 20ft-tall toxic debris mounds. Krop says her group\u2019s preference would be to have \u201cas clean an environment at sea as possible\u201d, adding that full removal would allow the ecosystem to return to its original function. The researchers say tests at the site show the fishes there don\u2019t have levels of heavy metals different from fish living away from the platforms in the vicinity, and that the companies are required to seal the wells after their lifespan is complete. For Love, it simply feels wrong to remove something that\u2019s home to millions of creatures. \u201cIt just pisses me off, the hypocrisy of environmental groups who say: yeah, we\u2019re all for biodiversity, except on artificial stuff, and then they can all die,\u201d he says. \u201cIt drives me insane.\u201d He draws the analogy with a mine whose resources have been tapped, and a mining company that wants to close it down, but bunnies and birds and deer have moved in. Do we blow up the mine and kill those animals, or let it remain in some modified form? \u201cWell, in our little story, people would freak out,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say: we don\u2019t want you to kill Bambi. But so what\u2019s the difference between killing Bambi and killing sea anemones?\u201d Hazelwood says she wants the public to look at the structures as more than what you see from a beach chair \u2013 \u201cnot just menacing industrial giants, but vibrant ecosystems that exist below the surface\u201d.

            "text": "On a sunny day in August, Ann Scarborough Bull and her colleagues set off on a boat named Danny C. Their destination was an old oil platform called Holly, located two miles off the coast of Santa Barbara. The researchers were not interested in the platform itself, but in what was happening beneath the waves. They used a remote-controlled vehicle to explore the area and were amazed to find hundreds of thousands of young rockfish living there. These fish had made a home amidst the metal structure, along with anemones, mussels, and jack mackerel. The researchers have been studying this phenomenon for many years. Holly is just one of 27 oil rigs built off the coast of California that have become rich ecosystems. Although they are man-made structures, these platforms have been in the ocean long enough to become part of the environment. They provide a safe haven for creatures like mussels and barnacles, which attract larger fish and sea lions. After studying the rigs for over 25 years, Bull believes they are extremely important for both commercial and recreational fishing, as well as for other marine life.\n\nHowever, as California and the US move away from offshore drilling and towards cleaner energy sources, a debate has emerged about the future of these disused rigs. Some people argue that they are harmful to the environment and should be completely removed. Others, including many scientists, believe that we should embrace these accidental havens and that removing them would be morally wrong. In other parts of the world, oil rigs have been successfully transformed into artificial reefs. Milton Love, a scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has a personal connection to this debate. He first encountered the rigs as a student in the late 1960s when he collected fish off the platforms for a public aquarium. He was amazed by the abundance of fish and later realized the diverse communities that had formed around the rigs. He now feels that removing these structures is immoral because they provide essential habitat for countless marine creatures. Bull agrees, stating that destroying this habitat would be like destroying a valuable kelp bed or rocky reef.\n\nLife always finds a way, especially in the ocean. If you drop a tire off a boat, within a month, you will find a species like the brown rockfish living in it. The same is true for the oil rigs. These structures were built between 1967 and 1989, and they quickly became populated by tiny plankton, which were followed by barnacles and then mussels. Soon after, fish started living in the rigs, taking advantage of the metal structure for protection. Within a year or two, a whole ecosystem had formed. Love and Bull have conducted extensive research on the rigs and estimate that billions of creatures, including barnacles, fish, and mammals, rely on them for habitat. A study they co-authored in 2014 found that the rigs were some of the most productive ocean habitats in the world, supporting a large number of fish and other marine life.\n\nSome species of rockfish produce 10 to 100 times more eggs and larvae at the rigs compared to natural reefs. This is partly because adult fish are often caught by fishermen at the reefs, leaving fewer of them to reproduce. In some cases, the rigs are crucial for the survival of certain fish populations. Love discovered that one-fifth of the average number of juvenile bocaccio rockfish, a commercially important but overfished species, survive each year at the rigs. Another study showed that when lingcod and rockfish were moved from the rigs to a natural reef, a significant portion of them swam back to the rigs, sometimes traveling more than seven miles in just a few hours.\n\nThe debate over the future of these oil rigs is not unique to California. In the Gulf of Mexico, over 570 platforms have been declared artificial reefs. Some have even been incorporated into national marine sanctuaries. Turning the rigs into reefs in California is technically and legally challenging due to the depth at which they are submerged and the cost involved in removing them. Estimates suggest that removing all the platforms off the California coast would cost $8 billion. In 2010, a plan was introduced that allowed oil companies to turn their platforms into artificial reefs and donate the money saved from removal to a state conservation fund. This plan has its supporters, who see it as a win-win situation for the state, the environment, and the companies. However, environmental groups oppose this plan, arguing that it lets fossil fuel companies off the hook and contributes to visual pollution in the ocean. They believe that fully removing the rigs would allow the ecosystem to return to its natural state.\n\nThe researchers argue that the fish and other creatures living around the rigs are not significantly affected by heavy metals. They also point out that the oil companies are required to seal the wells after they are no longer in use. Love is passionate about protecting these habitats and finds it hypocritical to advocate for biodiversity while dismissing the importance of man-made structures. He compares the situation to a mine that has been abandoned but has become a home to animals. He questions whether it is right to destroy that habitat just because it is not natural. Similarly, Emily Hazelwood, a marine conservation biologist, wants people to see the rigs as more than industrial eyesores. She wants them to recognize the vibrant ecosystems that exist beneath the surface.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over the future of California's disused oil rigs continues. Some argue for their complete removal, while others believe they should be transformed into artificial reefs. These rigs have become thriving ecosystems, supporting a wide variety of marine life. Scientists have conducted extensive research on the rigs and have found them to be highly productive habitats. Removing the rigs would destroy these habitats and disrupt the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. The decision about what to do with these rigs will have significant implications for the environment and the future of offshore drilling.",

            "text": "In an asphalt-surrounded greenhouse at the back of a business park in Hayward, California, on the shores of San Francisco Bay, a sea of more than 200 leafy, green, hybrid poplar saplings are itching to break free from their pots. Among them stands Maddie Hall. The trees are all \u201cmother trees\u201d, explains Hall, co-founder and CEO of climate biotech firm Living Carbon. They have been genetically altered (there are about 100 different lines) with the aim of making them better at absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2). The startup company propagates cuttings from the mothers either to study or to send to nurseries for larger-scale production. This spring, clones of four of its leading lines were planted on private land in Georgia and Ohio as pilot projects to monitor their carbon sequestration, through partnerships with willing landowners. Living Carbon\u2019s business model includes selling carbon removal credits, with landowners paid for the use of their property. About 170,000 seedlings of different tree varieties were planted over about 120 hectares (300 acres), about 5% of which were genetically modified poplars: the company is starting small, conscious of avoiding monocultures. \u201cNone of what we do matters if it just all stays at the greenhouse,\u201d says Hall. There are projects under way around the world to genetically engineer plants \u2013 namely crops \u2013 for traits such as bigger yields, disease resistance or drought or heat tolerance. But efforts to engineer them to do better at drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere to fight the climate crisis directly are newer. Living Carbon, founded in 2019 and which has received $36m in venture capital funding to date, is in the vanguard of establishing the technology in trees. Meanwhile, a handful of others, including two world-leading California-based scientific institutions, are tackling how it might be done in agricultural crops. Both the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego and the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) in Berkeley, a joint venture between the University of California, Berkeley and UC, San Francisco, have received large amounts of philanthropic funding. The possible impact of this approach on global CO2 emissions is difficult to quantify \u2013 it depends on how significant the gains could be, and how widely it\u2019s deployed. But its proponents are bullish that if scaled up it could make a significant contribution and buy the world some time. It is by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis \u2013 the process by which plants use light, water and CO2 to make sugars that fuel plant growth (with oxygen as the byproduct) \u2013 that Living Carbon\u2019s trees are able to capture more CO2 than they naturally would. Forests with their woody biomass and substantial rooting systems that last many decades are an important long-term carbon sink \u2013 if their trees can photosynthesise even better, that importance becomes supercharged. But increasing the amount of photosynthesis done by a plant isn\u2019t easy. Living Carbon gets round this by short-circuiting an inefficiency most plants also have which \u2013 contrary to the general pattern of photosynthesis \u2013 sees them regularly take up oxygen and give out some CO2 in daylight. Living Carbon tinkers with that process to channel that CO2 into tree growth. \u201cWe took a lot of learning from what had been shown to work well in crop plants and our big innovation was having a similar trait work in trees,\u201d says Hall. In a scientific paper published this April, the company reports that in a four-month-long greenhouse trial its modified poplars increased in biomass by 35-53% over its controls, equivalent to removing 17-27% more CO2 from the air. Several patents are now in the works, says Hall, and, in addition to the pilot plantings, a small field trial involving about 600 of the trees is under way at the University of Oregon to confirm the results.  All Living Carbon\u2019s planting is intended to be done on degraded mining or agricultural land where no trees currently grow. It aims to plant about 2,400 hectares (6,000 acres), around 4m trees) by the end of spring 2024 \u2013 roughly half of which will be photosynthesis-enhanced. But if it could scale that up to 1.6m hectares (4m acres) by 2030, that would mean \u2013 assuming a 40-year lifespan and that the enhanced trees guzzle carbon at the top rate observed in the greenhouse trials \u2013 more than 600 megatonnes of CO2 sequestered, which is about 1.6% of current global CO2 emissions. There\u2019s a lot of potential given that there are 60m hectares (148m acres) of land available for reforestation in the US alone, says Hall. Living Carbon was able to move forward quickly with the pilots because US regulators ruled that the trees need not be regulated as genetically engineered plants: there was no risk the genes being inserted could make them more invasive.  Meanwhile, arming crops to be better at removing CO2 requires a different approach. They are shorter-lived and harvested seasonally; what\u2019s left both above and below ground decomposes quickly, releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere. The focus for crops then is on engineering them so they are better able to store more carbon below ground for longer. It is also possible to stack traits \u2013 making plants better at both capturing and storing carbon. The goal is to take more carbon out of the atmosphere, funnel it into the soil and keep it there Plant scientists at the Salk have been working to engineer crop plants they call \u201cSalk Ideal Plants\u201d since 2017, though it wasn\u2019t until 2019 the project ramped up. The work, under the rubric of the Harnessing Plants Initiative (HPI), has received more than $127m in funding to date from the TED Audacious Project, the Bezos Earth Fund and the Hess Corporation, an oil and gas exploration and production company. Soya beans, rice, wheat, corn, rapeseed/canola, sorghum and CoverCress (a strain of field pennycress) are the current target crops. That they are planted on so much land already means there is capacity to have a large impact, say plant scientists Joanne Chory and Wolfgang Busch, the HPI founding director and executive director respectively. The focus is on modifying the crops in three ways that they hope will create dramatic changes. Those are: larger roots (more root mass means more carbon sequestered); roots that penetrate deeper into the soil (further down, microbial activity is lower so it takes longer to decompose and there are typically more minerals that the carbon can associate with to lock it away); and roots that produce more of a carbon-rich polymer called suberin. Produced by all land plants and the main component of cork, suberin is difficult for microbes to decompose so it could keep carbon locked underground far longer. \u201cSalk Ideal Plants will be the world champions of carbon sequestration,\u201d says Busch. Although things will vary with soil type, the scientists aim to develop crops that will be able to stabilise about 30% of the carbon that gets fixed from the air in the soil, up from very little, and they hope to have the plants grow on about 70% of the area where they grow currently. Particularly thanks to suberin and deeper roots, at least some of that would remain for decades. So far, the group have found tens of genes in other plants that they believe could enhance the traits, and they are now doing small-scale proof-of-concept experiments to test whether employing them in the crops or changing the equivalent genes in the crops can work. The aim is to make the plants available by the late 2020s or early 2030s and a company called Cquesta is being set up to take forward commercialisation. Meanwhile, about 500 miles north of the Salk and not too far from Living Carbon\u2019s greenhouse, is the IGI. It too has a crop effort under way, launched last year and funded by $11m from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The goal is \u201ctaking more carbon out of the atmosphere, funnelling it into the soil and trying to keep it there\u201d, says Brad Ringeisen, the IGI\u2019s executive director. And it doesn\u2019t start from scratch but brings together the ongoing work of several researchers at the IGI\u2019s partner institutions in both roots and leaves. Others on the scene include UK-based startup Wild Bio, a spin-out of Oxford University\u2019s Oxford Centre for Plant Science Innovation, founded in 2021. It hopes to genetically alter crops to produce more food and leave behind more carbon in the soil, drawing inspiration from plants in the wild. Legislation passed this March, which removes crops that are gene edited only from the regulatory system for genetically modified organisms in England \u2013 the US made a similar move in 2021 \u2013 will help the company, says Ross Hendron, its co-founder and CEO. The new law allows genetic changes in crop plants that could have been produced naturally, or by traditional cross-breeding \u2013 while stricter regulations for introducing genetic material from other species remain in place.  Yet moving these new superpowered plants forward commercially faces hurdles, starting with demonstrating they work in the real world. While Living Carbon may be planning to scale up planting, it remains to be seen whether the carbon-sequestration gains seen in the greenhouse trials translate outside, where conditions such as temperature, available water and nutrients aren\u2019t controlled, say experts. This environmental variability can make a \u201chuge difference\u201d to how things grow, says Christine Raines, a professor of plant biology at the University of Essex. It will also, she adds, take time to see \u2013 because conditions can change markedly from one year to the next. There are other factors. It has been found, for example, that trees now growing in warmer conditions because of climate change grow faster because they suck up more CO2 anyway \u2013 though the trade-off is that they might die sooner. Meanwhile for the Salk project, suberin \u2013 touted as a star for its potential to store carbon longer-term in the soil \u2013 may not work out as hoped. A possible problem noted by Raines and others is that by locking away carbon, it could reduce what\u2019s available to the crop to put towards yield. It may also interfere with root performance. The Salk scientists acknowledge there is work to do on suberin, and they are exploring how they might add enhanced photosynthetic efficiency to counter the potential yield problem.  Others doubt that developing such technology is the best way to proceed at all. There is no proof that it will work at scale, and it could take decades to develop, say campaign groups. Friends of the Earth Europe also says that no one knows the long-term impacts of modifying the genes of trees and plants through technologies. Better, they say, to focus on what has a proven record of cutting emissions \u2013 such as significantly increasing the number of trees and using low-till agriculture, which reduces soil disturbance and so promotes the storage of carbon in the soil naturally. \u201cLike so many novel tech approaches to tackling CO2 \u2026 [the development of such plants] represents a significant distraction,\u201d says Ben Raskin, the Soil Association\u2019s head of horticulture and agroforestry. Yet for the proponents of superpowering plants to directly counter the climate crisis, the world hasn\u2019t been reducing emissions at the rate required, and even if it were to reduce them to zero tomorrow, it would still need to remove carbon. Hall adds it would be a shame if the technology was prevented from moving forward because of concerns about genetic modification not founded in science. \u201cWe are in a climate emergency,\u201d she points out.

            "text": "In a greenhouse in Hayward, California, Maddie Hall is surrounded by over 200 hybrid poplar saplings. These trees, known as \"mother trees,\" have been genetically modified to absorb more carbon dioxide (CO2). Living Carbon, a climate biotech company, propagates cuttings from these trees for study and larger-scale production. The company recently planted clones of four of its leading lines on private land in Georgia and Ohio to monitor their carbon sequestration abilities. Living Carbon sells carbon removal credits and pays landowners for the use of their property. The company aims to avoid monocultures and plans to plant about 2,400 hectares of trees by the end of spring 2024.\n\nLiving Carbon's trees capture more CO2 by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light, water, and CO2 to make sugars. They have found a way to redirect the CO2 released during photosynthesis into tree growth. In a greenhouse trial, the modified poplars increased their biomass by 35-53% compared to the control group, removing 17-27% more CO2 from the air. Living Carbon is conducting further trials to confirm these results.\n\nThe Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) in California are also working on genetically engineering plants to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The Salk Institute aims to develop \"Salk Ideal Plants\" with larger roots, deeper penetration into the soil, and increased production of a carbon-rich polymer called suberin. The goal is to stabilize about 30% of the carbon fixed from the air in the soil and have the plants grow on 70% of their current area.\n\nWhile these efforts show promise, there are challenges to overcome. It is uncertain whether the gains seen in greenhouse trials will translate to real-world conditions where environmental factors vary. There are also concerns about the long-term impacts of genetic modification and the potential trade-offs in crop yield. Some argue that focusing on proven methods like increasing the number of trees and implementing low-till agriculture is a better approach to emissions reduction.\n\nHowever, proponents of superpowering plants believe that the world needs to remove carbon to address the climate crisis. They argue that concerns about genetic modification should not hinder the progress of this technology. With the urgency of the climate emergency, finding innovative solutions is crucial.",

            "text": "They were once so numerous they were cooked as the national dish of Dominica. Every year, thousands of mountain chicken frogs, roasted with garlic and pepper, were eaten by islanders and tourists. Two decades later, the animal \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest species of frog \u2013 has in effect disappeared from the Caribbean island. A series of ecological disasters has reduced its former healthy, stable population of hundreds of thousands of animals to a total of 21 frogs, according to scientists\u2019 most recent survey. The startling rapidity of Leptodactylus fallax\u2019s decline has stunned biologists who believe it is one of the fastest eradications of a wild animal ever recorded, an ecological calamity that demonstrates how quickly wildlife can be damaged and destroyed. \u201cThis is an amazing animal,\u201d said Andrew Cunningham, head of wildlife epidemiology for the Zoological Society London (ZSL). \u201cIt can grow to around 20cm in length and weigh more than a kilo. Both males and females play important roles in raising their young and it was one of Dominica\u2019s top predators that ate insects, small mammals, snakes \u2013 and other frogs.\u201d The island used to buzz with the sound of the call of the male mountain chicken frog, added Cunningham. \u201cToday there is only silence. This is a species facing imminent extinction in the wild, yet it was in a healthy state only a couples of decades ago. Its fate sends us a very clear warning about the dangers facing wildlife on Earth today.\u201d The initial cause of the mountain chicken frog\u2019s misfortunes was a chytrid fungus that first emerged in the last century and which infects amphibians\u2019 skin through which many of them drink and breathe. Frogs become lethargic and die within a month. The fungus has been blamed for significant amphibian declines in many parts of the world but nowhere has its impact been so rapid and all-consuming as it has been on the island of Dominica. Within 18 months of its first appearance in 2002, it had eliminated 80% of the island\u2019s population of mountain chicken frogs. \u201cThat is an astonishing decline,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cAnd its numbers continued to drop until it was undetectable in the wild on Dominica.\u201d Worse was to follow. The mountain chicken frog was at that time found on only one other place on Earth: the nearby island of Montserrat. Scientists urged authorities there to introduce strict quarantine measures to halt the disease from spreading across the island. \u201cThese warnings failed although, in one sense, we were prepared for the worst given what had happened in Dominica,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Valenzuela, a wildlife health expert at ZSL\u2019s Institute of Zoology. \u201cWe were able to collect some of the island\u2019s mountain chicken frogs before the disease began to spread to them in 2009 and these animals are now housed in bio-secure enclosures at several zoos in Europe, including London\u2019s.\u201d One other piece of encouraging news followed in Dominica with reports that a handful of surviving frogs had been uncovered and these animals appeared to be naturally resistant to the chytrid fungus. \u201cThings looked a bit better \u2013 until Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017,\u201d said Jeanelle Brisbane, wildlife ecologist with the Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division in Dominica and founder of WildDominique. \u201cIt was the strongest hurricane ever to have hit the island in our recorded history and the devastation shattered the already fragile population of frogs, reducing numbers by more than 90% \u2013 back down to double digits.\u201d This has left the once numerous mountain chicken frog in a dismal situation. There are zoo collections of animals from Montserrat in Europe. Crucially, these animals are not resistant to chytrid fungus and their usefulness for reintroduction is therefore limited.  Related: The lost world: Venezuela\u2019s unique tepui frogs face new perils  By contrast, those members of Leptodactylus fallax that are clinging on in Dominica are resistant but exist in only two small populations on land that offers no official protection to the species. In addition, climate changes are affecting both islands \u2013 drying out weather systems \u2013 and this is also hindering efforts to save the species. Its prospects look grim, though Brisbane remained optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to keep the mountain chicken frog alive and able to survive the fungal disease for over 20 years now, thanks to the collaboration that has gone in to saving this species. We should not forget that. If we can keep that up for just a bit longer, with the right resources, it is possible to turn their fate around. Certainly we are not giving up hope.\u201d Cunningham agreed. \u201cWe still have a couple of years to try to get something done before the mountain chicken frog becomes extinct in the wild. It\u2019s a tight situation.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 16 October 2023 to clarify that the mountain chicken frog faces extinction rather than has become extinct. ",

But now, these frogs are almost gone. A lot of bad things happened to them, like diseases and hurricanes, and now there are only 21 frogs left, according to scientists. This is really bad because it happened so quickly and it shows us how easily animals can be hurt and even disappear forever.\n\nThe mountain chicken frog used to be a big and important animal on the island. It could grow to be around 20cm long and weigh more than a kilo. Both male and female frogs were important parents and they would eat insects, small mammals, snakes, and even other frogs. The island used to be full of the sound of their calls, but now it's silent. This species is in danger of going extinct in the wild, and it was only a couple of decades ago that they were doing well. This is a warning about what can happen to wildlife on Earth.\n\nThe first problem for the mountain chicken frog was a disease called chytrid fungus. It started in the last century and it infects the frogs' skin, which is how they drink and breathe. The frogs become sleepy and die within a month. This disease has hurt a lot of frogs around the world, but it hurt the mountain chicken frog on Dominica really quickly. Within 18 months, it killed 80% of the frogs on the island. The disease also spread to the nearby island of Montserrat, where the frogs were also in danger.\n\nScientists tried to protect the frogs on Montserrat, but they weren't successful. Some of the frogs were brought to zoos in Europe to keep them safe, but they are not resistant to the disease. In Dominica, there were a few surviving frogs that were resistant to the disease, but then a big hurricane called Maria hit the island in 2017 and made things even worse. It destroyed a lot of the frogs' homes and reduced their numbers by more than 90%.\n\nNow, the mountain chicken frog is in a really bad situation. There are only a few left on Dominica, and they don't have any official protection. The climate is also changing on both islands, and this is making it even harder to save the frogs. But there is still hope. People have been working together to keep the frogs alive for over 20 years, and if they keep trying, there is a chance they can save the frogs from going extinct. They just need the right resources and a little more time.",

Following the global success of 2016\u2019s BBC\u2019s Planet Earth II and its famous \u201csnakes v iguanas\u201d scene, the corporation\u2019s natural history unit has spent five years pushing the boundaries of technology to deliver an equally jaw-dropping series. Episode one\u2019s producer/director Nick Easton said the team wanted an \u201conboard view\u201d of a whale in Argentina to show its point of view, but the technology did not exist. So over six months the team discussed the ethics of a \u201cwhalecam\u201d, followed by another year of development and consultation with whale scientists. In the end the thing that was the most difficult and took the longest time to develop was how to detach the camera once they had used it. So they developed a soluble clamping mechanism made of corn starch that released the camera after 20 minutes. Although only two of the stunning shots feature in the show, Easton said it was worth all the effort. \u201cThere\u2019s a human guinea pig somewhere in Bristol who was swimming up and down a swimming pool with that camera. I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d The eight-part Attenborough-narrated BBC Studios series also features never-before-seen footage of the world\u2019s largest colony of pearl octopus mothers slowly starving to death on the seabed as they protect their eggs for two years. Series producer Matt Brandon explained it was made by director Will Ridgeon in Bristol in his bedroom, \u201cdirecting a camera on a remotely operated vehicle thousands of miles away, two miles beneath the surface of the ocean. That certainly wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the original Planet Earth [in 2006].\u201d Around a third of the series was shot using remote cameras, partly due to Covid, but also to help reduce the team\u2019s carbon footprint. The environmental issue was also helped by the use of drones, rather than helicopters. The drones were multi-purpose. Easton said a shoot in one of the world\u2019s biggest caves featured, \u201ca drone ballet\u201d with one drone \u201cflying around in the dark lighting the space\u201d while communicating with the other which was filming.  Drones were also used to capture what Attenborough said was an \u201castounding\u201d seals-versus-sharks sequence in South Africa that took director Georgina Ward four years to capture and which Brandon said was \u201cnew behaviour\u201d. Other highlights include seals escaping from fishing nets, a father ostrich helping his chick survive, a jacana bird that issues a special \u201cfreeze\u201d call to its chicks, rarely seen footage of an angel fish and a breath-holding fish that fakes its own death. There are also scenes which show humanity\u2019s impact, including flamingoes in Mexico desperately trying to protect their chicks from being wiped out by storms hastened by climate change. The series also shows Attenborough in a Kent meadow that Charles Darwin walked in, reminding audiences about evolution. Executive producer Mike Gunton said Planet Earth III looks through \u201ca new lens \u2026 where the planet is changing and there\u2019s this huge force which Darwin would call a selection pressure. And that selection pressure is humanity.\u201d He said that while the drama of previous series remains, Planet Earth III has another context, which is how animals are adapting their lives to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world. Examples include a rhino walking through a Nepalese town and long-tailed macaques stealing iPhones from tourists to negotiate their return in exchange for food. Attenborough also contrasts his 1957 visit to tiny Raine Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding ground \u2013 with the situation today, where as a result of climate change it is set to disappear beneath the waves. Local conservationist Keiran Murphy is shown saving stranded turtles, saying: \u201cGovernments and big business need to get real.\u201d One episode is devoted to \u201chero\u201d conservationists and includes two women who dress in yellow to become foster mothers to baby bald ibis chicks \u2013 teaching them how to fly using microlights. It is thought that the colour yellow is attractive to the young creatures. Another first is a podcast that will accompany the series, featuring Attenborough, Gunton and other programme makers. Gunton paid tribute to the perseverance of the crew, who filmed in 43 countries across six continents. One cameraman, Abdullah Khan, took five-second micro-naps during 16 straight days in a 40-degree heat hide, while a crew on remote Ellesmere island in Canada had to dig a runway so a plane could get them out. The BBC reduced its climate impact by using more local camera operators and training new ones through a BBC Studios scheme called Songbird. Gunton said it had given the show a different perspective and Brandon said it had helped reduce shoot cancellations as, due to climate change, \u201cit\u2019s more difficult to predict exactly\u201d when things will happen. However, Gunton said he was optimistic for the future, as when Attenborough filmed in Darwin\u2019s meadow it was \u201calive\u201d with insects and gave the pair hope. Planet Earth III is airing at an earlier time than previous series, with the aim of allowing more children to watch and become involved. Attenborough told the Observer: \u201cChildren have an instinctive understanding about the way the world operates. By and large, children are better at understanding the natural world and as adults we should be making more opportunities for them to do that.\u201d ",

Now, a group of scientists are hoping they have found a way to deplete the UK\u2019s rapidly growing Chinese mitten crab population and prevent the crustaceans, which can grow bigger than a 10-inch dinner plate and have distinctive furry claws, from \u201ceating us out of house and home\u201d. The group has constructed and installed the UK\u2019s first Chinese mitten crab trap at Pode Hole in Lincolnshire, to catch the voracious predators as they migrate downstream to mate. \u201cThe mitten crab are eating our native fauna,\u201d said Dr Paul Clark of the Natural History Museum, one of the scientists working on the project. \u201cIf we start capturing these crabs and depleting their population, we might see changes in our environment for the better.\u201d This could include an increase in the local population of spined loach, a freshwater fish which is reported to have declined at Pode Hole, along with water voles, bivalve mollusks, small shrimp and snails. The Chinese mitten crab, so-called because it originated in south-east Asia, was first sighted in the UK in 1935. Since then its population has exploded.  Related: Wildcats released in Scottish Highlands in effort to prevent extinction in UK  \u201cFemales can spawn two series of eggs, and they spawn somewhere between 500,000 and one million eggs in one go,\u201d said Clark. \u201cThere\u2019s millions in the Thames and huge populations in the Medway, the Ouse Washes, the Dee, Tyneside and the Humber. They are eating us out of house and home.\u201d He described seeing a mitten crab devouring a snail. \u201cThe crab treated it like an ice-cream cone. It nipped off the top, pulled the snail out from its shell \u2013 and ate it.\u201d Similarly, he said, his students have filmed a mitten crab \u201ccrushing an amphipod against the underside of its carapace, and with its other claw, it killed the shrimp and ate it\u201d. Research has shown the crabs also eat salmon and trout eggs \u2013 native fish species which are already under threat in the wild. The scientists plan to freeze the crabs they catch, and then hope to be able to dissect them to find out what they have been feeding on. \u201cIf we can, we will do some DNA analysis on the digested guts.\u201d The \u201cexperimental\u201d trap, which has a unique letterbox construction, was designed by Mick Henfrey, a foreman at the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, and Oscar Jones, a graduate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Sheffield. Jones came up with the idea for the project after a Chinese Mitten crab was spotted by a member of the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust climbing over the weir at Pode Hole. \u201cWe got together and decided to build a trap and the Environment Agency gave us permission to set it,\u201d said Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s like an extended letterbox that goes across the weir, with two openings, one facing upstream and one downstream. We hope they will climb into the letter box and then up a tube.\u201d He said the trap will be inspected every day and hopes that, if it is successful, other traps can be installed in rivers such as the Dee, an important salmon habitat. The project is being run in conjunction with the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board. Members of the public are asked to report sightings of Chinese mitten crab online at mittencrabs.org.uk. ",

            "text": "Scientists have found a way to deal with a big problem in the UK. There are too many Chinese mitten crabs, which are a type of crab that doesn't belong here. They are causing trouble by eating other animals and taking over their homes. So, the scientists have made a special trap to catch the crabs. They put the trap in a place called Pode Hole in Lincolnshire, where the crabs like to go to have babies. The scientists hope that by catching the crabs, they can help other animals and make things better. One animal that might benefit is the spined loach, a type of fish that has been decreasing in numbers at Pode Hole. The crabs are also eating water voles, bivalve mollusks, small shrimp, and snails. The Chinese mitten crabs were first seen in the UK in 1935, and since then, their population has gotten really big. The female crabs can lay a lot of eggs, between 500,000 and one million at a time. The crabs are eating so much that the scientists say they are \"eating us out of house and home.\" One of the scientists saw a crab eat a snail like it was an ice cream cone, and another one saw a crab crush a shrimp and eat it. The crabs also eat the eggs of salmon and trout, which are types of fish that are already in danger of disappearing. The scientists want to catch the crabs and freeze them. Then, they can look inside the crabs to see what they have been eating. They might even do some tests on the crabs' stomachs to learn more. The scientists made a special trap for the crabs. It was designed by Mick Henfrey and Oscar Jones. Mick works for a group that takes care of the land and water, and Oscar is a graduate from a university. They made a trap that looks like a long box with openings on both ends. The crabs can climb into the box and then go up a tube. The trap will be checked every day to see if any crabs are inside. If the trap works well, the scientists want to put more traps in other rivers, like the Dee, where salmon live. The scientists are working with the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board on this project. They also want people to help by reporting any sightings of Chinese mitten crabs on a website called mittencrabs.org.uk.",

            "text": "For 13 years, Mike Deacon monitored pollution levels in the river Ouse in Sussex, gathering data as a volunteer to help the Environment Agency take action. As a lifelong angler who grew up close to the river, its waters were precious to him. Now he is taking Southern Water to court, counter-suing the company for \u201closs of amenity\u201d after it began legal action over his unpaid bills. Since 2021 Deacon has refused to pay more than \u00a31 a month because he blames Southern Water for river pollution. \u201cThat\u2019s all they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t pay them for polluting my local river. Their contribution to pollution in the river system and the seas has led to a reduction in fish stocks. I can\u2019t swim in the river any more. I can\u2019t go kayaking there any more.\u201d Deacon is one of a number of customers withholding money from their water bills, with others joining a bills boycott and refusing to pay the wastewater element of their bills in protest at river and sea pollution. Earlier this month, the Consumer Council for Water said more customers complained about Southern Water than any other water company and named it and Thames Water as the \u201cstandout poor performers\u201d in dealing with complaints. The water industry has been under fire over leaks and sewage spills, and for taking out debts worth \u00a354bn since privatisation in 1989 while paying out \u00a366bn to shareholders during the same period. Companies have asked customers to foot a \u00a396bn bill to upgrade the water network, with plans to tackle sewage, reduce leaks and build new reservoirs. \u201cSo, on the one hand, I\u2019m having to pay for them to pollute my river,\u201d Deacon said. \u201cAnd on the other, I\u2019m having to pay for their fines, and put money into the pockets of their shareholders. I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d Deacon, a former advertising art director, began fishing at the age of five, catching eels with his father and getting along to the river with his friends from the Landport estate in Lewes whenever he could. The Sussex Ouse flows for 42 miles through the county, taking in a network of 750 miles of rivers, streams and brooks, including chalk streams where sea trout spawn and grow from small fry into fish. \u201cAs I got older I started to learn more about the species and their habits and lifestyles, and started catching the occasional sea trout \u2013 this magnificent fish that was a bit of an enigma,\u201d said Deacon. In 2009, he was so dismayed by the state of the river that he organised a clean-up, inviting local people to clear a stretch of the river in Lewes: they pulled out 28 shopping trolleys, 12 bikes and two full-sized goalposts in a section of river just 30 metres by 10 metres. \u201cThe Environment Agency was saying \u2018it\u2019s not our job\u2019, and the council was saying \u2018it\u2019s not our job\u2019, so I organised a clean-up,\u201d he said. As a result, the Sussex Ouse Conservation Society, which is now the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust (OART), recruited him to be its pollution monitor \u2013 a role that he gave up last month because of his dispute with Southern Water \u2013 and he worked on several serious pollution incidents, gathering water samples and evidence used by the Environment Agency to enforce pollution controls.  Deacon was also tasked with collecting water samples from sites across his catchment to be analysed for water quality in the OART laboratory. Water companies are not solely responsible for pollution in rivers. Farmers abstract water for their crops and use fertilisers, which can run off into rivers. Tyre and exhaust particles also run off roads. Water companies are also allowed to pump untreated sewage into rivers on days of unusually heavy rainfall, but Southern Water has been accused of \u201cdry spills\u201d \u2013 pumping in sewage on dry days. In 2021, Southern Water was fined a record \u00a390m after pleading guilty to 6,971 unpermitted sewage discharges. Deacon said that by measuring pollutants in the river, he could see that the sewage discharges by the 34 treatment plants upstream of his stretch were contributing to a deterioration of river environment for the fish and wildlife. He believes there has been a drop of 75% in the levels of roach, bream and dace and he believes sea trout may become extinct in the Sussex Ouse if pollution remains at its current levels. Southern Water disputes this claim. The most recent salmonid and freshwater fisheries data shows that in 2021 there were 17 sea trout catches in the Sussex Ouse reported by licensed anglers, substantially lower than the 10-year mean of 54.4 per year. Until 2018, anglers caught at least 50 sea trout a year, except in 2016. Katy Colley, from the website boycottwaterbills.com, said: \u201cWe only recently became aware of Mike\u2019s personal fight but he is not alone. We know there are thousands of people all over the country who feel they can no longer stand by and watch as criminal polluters destroy our precious ecosystems. We know how important the Sussex Ouse is to Mike and we salute his courage, tenacity and passion in taking on Britain\u2019s worst performing water company.\u201d Southern Water said it had paid no dividends since 2017 and customer bills had fallen in real terms by 20% since 2010. A spokesperson added: \u201cWe are aware of a very small number of claims and counter-claims from customers who are being pursued for unpaid bills. No claim that has reached court has been successful, and we will continue to defend any claims vigorously. \u201cWe are very conscious of the impact we have on our environment and work carefully to protect it. We are investing \u00a33bn between 2020 and 2025 \u2013 equivalent to \u00a31,500 per household \u2013 to improve environmental performance, prevent pollution and fix leaks. \u201cWe are also working hard to balance making vital improvements to our network while keeping customer bills as low as possible, and will only move at a pace that is acceptable to both our communities and the regulator.\u201d ",

A survey commissioned by Protect, a charity that defends whistleblowers, found fear of reprisals and uncertainty about how to provide proof were the main barriers to reporting on poor and misleading behaviour about the environment. Employees were also sceptical that their concerns would be properly dealt with. The organisation started investigating after receiving a \u201csurprisingly\u201d low number of calls about the environment to its whistleblowing advice hotline. Of the handful who had contacted Protect about an environmental issue at work over the past decade, three-quarters said they faced negative treatment as a result. Workers inside organisations can often be the first to spot environmental harms, from the illegal dumping of chemicals into a river to false claims about a product\u2019s sustainability. Whistleblowers can make a difference by reporting those concerns. A gas company was fined after a whistleblower identified dangerous regulatory breaches while civil servants speaking anonymously to the press helped expose failures by England\u2019s environmental regulator to prevent water pollution. In Germany, Desiree Fixler lost her jobafter exposing corporate greenwashing at Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm DWS Group. But her actions led to several regulatory investigations and recently forced the company into a multibillion-dollar settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cWorkers are the eyes and ears of an organisation and are best placed to spot when things go wrong,\u201d said Caitl\u00edn Comins, a legal officer at Protect. \u201cWith the right information, they can raise concerns and damage can be prevented, minimising the impact on the environment. By exposing environmental wrongdoing, they can also help ensure organisations are accountable for their climate impact and there is appropriate intervention where required.\u201d Legal experts say growing requirements on companies, especially publicly listed ones, to disclose and control their environmental impacts give employees new opportunities to highlight discrepancies between what their employer says in public and what it is actually doing. Protect acknowledges there are risks involved in whistleblowing, but says it has found little understanding among UK workers that they can raise environmental concerns and receive some legal protection. To help address this it has published a guide for environmental whistleblowers, which explains how the law works, how to raise concerns properly and how to seek redress for victimisation. Workers can also raise concerns directly to the UK\u2019s environmental regulators, although few people currently do so; between April 2021 and March 2022 they only received 38 disclosures between them. The Competition and Markets Authority, which has been investigating a number of green claims and has new powers to fine companies, invites anonymous tips but has not yet received any whistleblowing disclosures related to environmental matters. Natalie Prosser, the chief executive of the Office for Environmental Protection, said her organisation was a safe space for people to report their concerns. \u201cIt is critical that we do this alongside other prescribed persons, now more than ever, to ensure that potential threats to the natural environment can be identified and where possible, guarded against.\u201d Arpita Dutt, a lawyer who represents whistleblowers and is chair of Parrhesia, a charity supporting the human rights of UK whistleblowers, hoped the new guide would raise public awareness about the law. \u201cUltimately, we may see the rise of environmental whistleblowers and, importantly, the apprehension of further environmental harm.\u201d ",

They also don't think their concerns will be taken seriously. Protect started looking into this because they noticed that very few people were calling their helpline to report environmental issues at work. Out of the few who did, three-quarters said they were treated badly because of it. It's often the workers inside a company who see things like chemicals being dumped into a river or false claims about a product's sustainability. Whistleblowers can help by reporting these concerns. For example, a gas company got fined because a whistleblower noticed they were breaking safety rules. In England, some government workers talked to the press anonymously and helped show that the environmental regulator was failing to stop pollution in the water. In Germany, a woman named Desiree Fixler lost her job after exposing a company's lies about being environmentally friendly. But her actions led to investigations and a big settlement with the US government. Protect says workers are the best ones to notice when something is wrong and by speaking up, they can prevent damage to the environment. Experts say that companies now have to be more open about their environmental impact, and this gives employees a chance to point out when the company isn't doing what it says. Protect knows that there are risks to being a whistleblower, but they say that many workers in the UK don't know that they can raise environmental concerns and be protected by the law. To help with this, they made a guide that explains how to report concerns and what to do if you're treated badly because of it.

The Office for Environmental Protection says they're a safe place for people to report their concerns.

It lies along a track off the road between Knighton and Presteigne near the England-Wales border, looking down from a site of no great elevation, but of seclusion and quiet beauty, on to the valley of the River Lugg. I visited here last week. Swallows and house martins still hawked around in pursuit of sparse insect fare, feeding up before long southwards migration. Swifts had left weeks before. I first came to this lovely place 40 years ago. The little church, St Mary\u2019s, with its sturdy bell tower, then had something of a ramshackle, neglected air. My late son Will was with me. I told him the story of Owain Glynd\u0175r\u2019s great uprising against English rule at the outset of the 15th century. It was here at Pilleth, on 22 June 1402, that he fought a major battle against the English force of Edmund Mortimer. As with the battle at Hyddgen the previous year, ground advantage was to the Welsh: Glynd\u0175r\u2019s warriors had established themselves on the steep ridge of Bryn Glas above the church. The English stumbled up the steep hill; Glynd\u0175r\u2019s men fell upon them. The Welsh longbowmen in the English force suddenly changed sides and allied with Glynd\u0175r. Mortimer\u2019s soldiers were slaughtered, he was taken prisoner and married off to a daughter of Glynd\u0175r. It was the actions of the Welsh female camp-followers after the battle that struck a crucial psychological blow. They cut off the genitals of the English dead and left them lolling from their mouths. The story was widely circulated by medieval chroniclers, and instilled dread. Twenty years ago on a window ledge within the whitewashed church were spurs, a sword, a cuirass. They were not from the battle, but had belonged to Si\u00f4n ap Rhys, MP for Brecon in the early 16th century. Within the last 20 years they\u2019ve been stolen. I walk outside and stand by a marked mass grave in the churchyard. A barn owl ghosts by, tail of some small rodent trailing from its talons. Jackdaws are clamorous from the nearby copse of Wellingtonia that marks another mass grave. Pipistrelles jag past. Silence and darkness are gathering as I leave. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary ",

After the battle, the Welsh women who were with the army did something very shocking. They cut off the private parts of the dead English soldiers and left them hanging out of their mouths. This made people very scared. Twenty years ago, there were some old things in the church that belonged to a guy named Si\u00f4n ap Rhys. He was a member of Parliament a long time ago. But those things got stolen in the last 20 years. Outside the church, there is a special grave where many people were buried. I saw a barn owl fly by with a little animal's tail in its claws. There were also noisy jackdaws in the nearby trees. Some small bats flew past too. It was getting dark and quiet as I left.",

The number of communities threatened by the military\u2019s pollution is likely to increase as further more investigations are carried out. The defense department has only looked at about one-third of more than 700 facilities suspected of having contaminated the ground with PFAS.  Related: Drinking water of millions of Americans contaminated with \u2018forever chemicals\u2019  While the report acknowledges the pollution, it does not clarify which drinking water sources are polluted, how high PFAS levels are in the polluted water systems, or provide information about the plumes\u2019 locations. The sheer number of bases and the lack of clarity is \u201cshocking\u201d, said Scott Faber, the vice-president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks military PFAS pollution. \u201cA good neighbor would let you know that their use of PFAS was the reason your water was contaminated, and a bad neighbor would only tell you: \u2018Hey, a plume is heading in your direction,\u2019\u201d Faber said. The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because most do not degrade in the environment. The military is considered one of the largest PFAS polluters in the world, largely due to its use of firefighting foam laced with the chemicals discharged during emergencies or training exercises. Some of the highest levels of PFAS in groundwater ever detected have been found around bases. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s advisory health guidelines state that less than one part per trillion (ppt) in drinking water is safe, while levels found around military bases have exceeded 2.25m ppt. Congress in recent years has included in Defense Authorization Acts requirements for the military to begin investigating PFAS pollution in and around its facilities. The defense department has so far confirmed PFAS contamination at 455 bases, it wrote in the new report, and of that group it has confirmed that 275 out of 295 checked, or about 90%, have plumes \u201cin the proximity\u201d of drinking water supplies. The report does not clarify what \u201cin the proximity\u201d means and does not specify which types of drinking water supplies are threatened. Though it provides a list of bases, public drinking water systems can draw from surface water or community wells, and it is unclear how the plumes may be impacting those pulling water from private wells. \u201cThat is what we know so far because that\u2019s all the DoD told us, and it took an act of Congress to get that much information,\u201d Faber said. Though the report does not provide clarity on which communities are drinking contaminated water, the defense department in August issued a separate report revealing that it is now providing clean drinking water to 53 communities. The military currently only provides clean drinking water for communities with levels of PFOA and PFOS, two kinds of PFAS compounds, above 70 ppt. The EPA is proposing lowering the legal limit to 4 ppt. If it does, as expected, the defense department will likely be forced to provide drinking water to most, if not all, communities around facilities where there is PFAS contamination. Even as the military uncovers more PFAS pollution in and around its sites, the amount of spending on remediation of all pollution at its bases is dropping. \u201cCommunities around the facilities must be really frustrated because they in all likelihood are drinking from wells that are contaminated by the military, but the DoD is coming up short,\u201d Faber said. \u201cInevitably we will get answers for these questions as we move through the process.\u201d ",

So far, the defense department has only looked into about one-third of the over 700 suspected facilities that may have contaminated the ground with PFAS. The report acknowledges the pollution but does not provide specific information about which drinking water sources are polluted or the extent of contamination. This lack of clarity and the sheer number of bases involved is concerning, according to Scott Faber, the vice-president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. PFAS are a type of chemical used to make products resistant to water, stains, and grease. They have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, birth defects, and kidney disease. The military, due to its use of firefighting foam containing PFAS, is one of the largest polluters of these chemicals in the world.

However, the report does not clarify what \"near\" means or specify which types of drinking water supplies are threatened. The defense department is currently providing clean drinking water to 53 communities, but only if the levels of certain PFAS compounds exceed a certain limit. If the Environmental Protection Agency lowers the legal limit, which it is expected to do, the defense department will likely have to provide clean drinking water to most, if not all, communities near contaminated facilities. Despite the increasing evidence of PFAS pollution, the amount of money spent on cleaning up pollution at military bases is decreasing. Faber believes that communities near these facilities are frustrated because they are likely drinking contaminated water, but the defense department is not doing enough to address the issue.",

            "text": "The courteous agreement to an interview came with a twist in its tail. \u201cShall we have lunch? Do you eat whale meat?\u201d asks Kristj\u00e1n Loftsson, 80, the last hunter of fin whales in Europe, and a man unafraid of controversy. For more than five decades Loftsson has stubbornly swum against the tide, whether that be public opinion, domestic regulation or an almost complete international consensus. \u201cWhen they compare me to [Captain Ahab in] Moby-Dick, that\u2019s an honour,\u201d Loftsson says of the 19th-century tale of a seafarer\u2019s bloody quest for revenge against a whale that had bit off his leg. Loftsson\u2019s home country of Iceland is one of the only countries in the world that defies the International Whaling Commission\u2019s ban on commercial whaling, along with Japan and Norway. However, in Norway, the other European outlier, they hunt the minke whale, the populations of which are considered stable. The continued use off the Icelandic coast of grenade-tipped harpoons to kill fin whales \u2013 a species that is one of the world\u2019s largest animals and listed as endangered by the WWF \u2013 has naturally been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for environmental movements for decades, a symbol to many of humanity\u2019s cruel exploitation of nature. At the centre of the raucous controversy has been Loftsson, depicted as an almost pantomime villain by some of his opponents. He has run Hvalur, Iceland\u2019s only whaling company, since inheriting the business on the death of his father, Loftur, in 1974. Memorable moments have included famous clashes on the high seas with Greenpeace\u2019s Rainbow Warrior ships through the 1970s and 80s and the sinking in November 1986 of two of his whaling vessels in Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, a fjord north of the capital, Reykjav\u00edk, by activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Why should Iceland take the risk of keeping up whaling, which has not brought any economic gain? \u201cActually, we were not using those two, so they took the wrong vessels,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut we were insured by Lloyd\u2019s of London; they paid for it.\u201d Last week Loftsson agreed to meet at the wood-panelled \u00der\u00edr Frakkar restaurant, near Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s city centre, with there being every sign that his difficult and contentious business is now becoming an impossible one. His two vessels, Hvalur 8 and Hval-ur 9, landed three whales on 30 September, bringing to a close this year\u2019s hunting season with a final catch of 23 (another whale was killed but sank to the seabed). The Icelandic government has suggested this might be the end of it all, marking what would be a potentially historic transition and one that in August won the backing of the Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio, who called for an outright ban in an Instagram post. \u201cNot [looking] promising, no?\u201d says Loftsson of the political pressures, as he uses chopsticks to tuck into a piece of fermented whale blubber laid out on a platter of local specialities. (The Guardian declined the smoked, raw and fermented whale on offer.) But he adds: \u201cI\u2019m not worried. I know the people here and the politics better than many. I think it will be no problem. I am confident that we will be whaling next year.\u201d Since 2006, Iceland has set quotas for hunting fin whales. The company\u2019s five-year permit to hunt 161 fin whales a season will formally end this December, with the fisheries minister, Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir, signalling that it may be the last. \u201cWhy should Iceland take the risk of keeping up whaling, which has not brought any economic gain, in order to sell a product for which there is hardly any demand?\u201d she wrote last year. \u201cA Stalinist,\u201d Loftsson says of her. It has been a difficult season. Hunting was initially delayed after a study published by Iceland\u2019s Food and Veterinary Authority in May claimed that last year\u2019s killings had taken too long, with some of the 15-metre-long animals taking two hours to die after being harpooned multiple times. The weapons are supposed to kill the animal almost immediately by sending an explosive wave through the whale\u2019s body. Then, as the season was due to recommence at the start of September, with the company having met new regulatory demands, two young women clambered into the crow\u2019s nests of Hvalur\u2019s two operating whaling ships and refused to come down despite some police manhandling. They disembarked after 34 hours. \u201cVagabonds,\u201d Loftsson calls them. Back out at sea, there was another problem on 7 September when a mechanical failure led to a harpooned whale still being alive while hooked. The crew could not get close enough to euthanise the animal but nor could it be released. The wounded whale had to be harpooned again half an hour after the initial strike. Iceland does not need this, says \u00c1rni Finnsson, chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. He believes that without Loftsson, whom Finnsson describes as smart and capable of great charm, whaling would be finished. A recent poll suggests 42% of Icelanders oppose the trade, while 29% support it. Valger\u00f0ur \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir has been organising protests against Iceland\u2019s whale hunting since 2018. She does not believe new quotas will be issued by the fisheries minister, who is from the green faction of the ruling coalition that also includes the conservative Independence party. There is also a bill going through parliamentary committees that could ban whale hunting. Arnadottir lists the reasons Iceland should turn the page. \u201cIt is just animal abuse,\u201d she says firstly, adding: \u201cThey are very important to the ecosystem. \u201cThe more whales there are, the more fish,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause they take the nutrients from the bottom and get it to the surface, where the fish eat it.\u201d Whale meat is no longer eaten much in Iceland but is instead being \u201csold to Japan as a delicacy\u201d, she says. It is not profitable as an industry, she claims, and damages the tourism and film industry. \u201cSome of the biggest directors and actors in the world now have pledged not to come to Iceland with their projects,\u201d she says, adding that Loftsson \u201cwould not be hunting if he was not a supporter of the Independence party\u201d. It is just a business \u2026 it is a resource we can utilise Loftsson, who says he donates to other parties too, including the Left-Green Movement, is today one of Iceland\u2019s richest men, having diversified his business into a major investment company with large shareholdings in banks, fisheries and IT companies. It is clear that he does not need to hunt whales. That he continues to do so can perhaps be explained by a stubborn refusal to be put out of business by what he terms the \u201canti-everything\u201d brigade, with which he has long been locked in battle and that he suggests will go for the fisheries sector next, a mainstay of the Icelandic economy. He suggests whaling is no more cruel than the UK\u2019s deer hunting. While admitting \u201cmishaps\u201d occur, Loftsson claims the vast majority of whales lose consciousness almost immediately. As for the ecosystem, he says populations are healthy in Iceland\u2019s maritime exclusive economic zone, and globally are no more vulnerable than cod stocks in the north Atlantic. \u201cDo you want to close down all the fish and chip shops in the UK?\u201d he asks. (The International Union for Conservation of Nature red list classifies fin whales as vulnerable.) Loftsson\u2019s company sells 90% of its produce to Japan but there is a thriving market for it, he says, and a profit was made in 2022, despite the difficulties in finding shipping companies to export the meat. He also claims that the largest whale-watching companies lost money over the past decade. Loftsson does not expect the whale-hunting ban to be approved by parliament. Indeed, he has \u201cgamechanging\u201d ideas for his trade. Freeze-dried whale tablets could be just the iron supplement the world needs, Loftsson suggests. Whale tablets? \u201cIt is the biggest health problem in the world: lack of iron,\u201d he claims. \u201cDo you want to have constipation and diarrhoea?\u201d  Related: Whales take up to two hours to die after being harpooned, Icelandic report finds  With a glint in his eye, he says he is also looking at whether he might sell whale deaths as a carbon credit. The animals\u2019 faeces are rich in nutrients that stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which then capture carbon dioxide. But Loftsson suggests the carbon dioxide emitted from whales\u2019 blowholes could outweigh it. \u201cEach fin whale gets to 70 years old and the average age of the whales we are culling is about 26 years,\u201d, he says. \u201cI want a credit for that as they won\u2019t be doing that any more.\u201d He dismisses an assertion that he only continues whaling due to a deathbed promise to his father. \u201cNo, no, he was a realist,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is just a business. We have the equipment; it is a resource we can utilise.\u201d As he enters his ninth decade, the last whaler is showing no signs of retiring his harpoons. \u201cThere are about 40,000 fin whales [around Iceland],\u201d he claims, adding: \u201cThe quota is maybe 160 or something like that. So, we can carry on for ever.\u201d ",

Loftsson's company sells most of its whale meat to Japan, but there is a declining demand for it in Iceland.

The project, the first time a predatory mammal has been deliberately reintroduced in the UK, was set up after the cats\u2019 numbers plummeted as a result of significant losses of native woodland, human persecution and interbreeding with domestic cats. In 2019, a landmark report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature said the Scottish wildcat population was close to being functionally extinct because of a loss of genetic integrity and population decline.

Over the past three months, 19 young wildcats, raised from cats held in British collections including a number living in captivity at the RZSS wildlife park, have been released at a secret location in the Cairngorms, protected by CCTV cameras. Each has been fitted with a GPS tag regularly monitored by staff from the Saving Wildcats programme, so their movements and behaviour can be tracked. The project also provides extra food, to supplement their normal diet of rabbits, voles and mice. One of the 19 wildcats has since died, but the rest appear to be thriving and are venturing away from the release site, said Dr Helen Senn, who leads the RZSS project at the Highland wildlife park near Kingussie. \u201cIt has been really positive, in the main,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have seen evidence that the cats are able to hunt and fend for themselves. From that perspective, we\u2019re really happy.\u201d She said the first test would come this winter, once their quarry becomes scarce and colder weather sets in. The decision to rear the cats a few miles away was deliberate, she added. It meant the animals experienced identical weather and ecological conditions, and had a far less stressful journey to the release site; the stressful process of travelling long distances and arriving in unfamiliar terrain can increase mortalities in release programmes. It will be several years before its success can be evaluated. There will be two further releases in 2024 and 2025, at different sites in the Cairngorms. The team have fitted 100 camera traps in the area, to record the first group\u2019s activities but also monitor other animals in the forest. Senn said that if the species is truly to reestablish itself across Scotland, then the government and conservation movement must consider introducing strict measures to control domestic cats. Those may need to include mandatory neutering of domestic cats \u2013 an approach that enjoyed high levels of public compliance in the Cairngorms release area, and mandatory micro-chipping, to prevent cross breeding and to allow proper monitoring of cats in the wild. There also needed to be concerted efforts to expand the rich native woodlands that wildcats need, which in turn requires large-scale collaborations by private and public landowners of the kind seen in the Cairngorms, where most landowners collaborate in a rewilding programme known as Cairngorms Connect. Senn said the wildcats project is the latest in a number of successful reintroductions, which included species such as beavers, sea eagles and golden eagles, but also conservation projects such as those devoted to red squirrels. Beavers in Scotland are now so numerous that NatureScot, the conservation agency, predicts there could be 10,000 living in the wild by 2030. \u201cThere\u2019s a real, positive groundswell of support for species recovery projects,\u201d Senn said. \u201cSeeing success creates positivity and it generates hope. Conservation can be quite depressing and I think it\u2019s really important that people feel it can make a difference.\u201d However, people need to know there is no quick fix, she said, adding: \u201cWe can\u2019t speed up ecological processes.\u201d Steve Micklewright, chief executive of the rewilding charity Trees for Life, said much of the success seen in Scotland was because its devolved government, a coalition between the Scottish National party and Scottish Greens, was creating \u201cthe political space\u201d for conservation. A new natural environment bill, its ambitious biodiversity strategy and its land reforms, including tackling environmental abuses on grouse moors, were quite unlike anywhere else in the UK. \u201cThat\u2019s different, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d he said. Beavers One of Scotland\u2019s greatest reintroduction stories, beavers are recolonising the southern Highlands and spreading south towards the Tweed. Extinct in the wild until the early 2000s, the estimated Scottish population is about 1,500. Capercaillie Once abundant yet now facing extinction, capercaillie numbers have stabilised to about 540 adults after concerted conservation efforts in secluded forests in the Cairngorms and northern Highlands. Red squirrel Muscled out of their natural woodland range by grey squirrels across Britain, red squirrels are recovering in the Highlands and spreading north; some have been reintroduced around Shieldaig and Plockton on the west coast. Golden eagles Persecuted for decades by gamekeepers and farmers, this apex predator is recovering fast, with well over 500 breeding pairs across Scotland, including 46 birds in the Scottish borders thanks to a recent relocation project. Pine marten A cat-sized member of the weasel family, this woodland predator was persecuted heavily by gamekeepers. It is recovering, chiefly in the Highlands, but remains rare. Scotland\u2019s population is estimated at 3,700 adults. ",

The cats were raised at a wildlife park to increase their numbers before being released. This is the first time a predatory mammal has been reintroduced in the UK. The wildcats' population has decreased due to loss of woodland, human persecution, and breeding with domestic cats. A report in 2019 showed that the Scottish wildcat population was close to extinction. Over the past few months, 19 young wildcats have been released in a secret location in the Cairngorms, protected by CCTV cameras. Each cat has a GPS tag so its movements can be monitored. The cats are also given extra food to supplement their diet. One of the wildcats has died, but the rest are doing well. The cats will face their first challenge this winter when food becomes scarce and the weather gets colder. The project will continue with two more releases in 2024 and 2025. The team has set up 100 camera traps to monitor the cats and other animals in the forest. To ensure the wildcats' survival, measures need to be taken to control domestic cats and expand native woodlands. The Scottish government and conservation movement must work together on this. The project is part of a series of successful reintroductions and conservation efforts in Scotland. The success is due to the government's support for conservation and its land reforms. Other successful reintroductions include beavers, capercaillie, red squirrels, golden eagles, and pine martens. It is important to remember that conservation takes time and cannot be rushed.",

Speaking to the Guardian at the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in Marrakech, Stiglitz said developing nations needed their equivalent of the US Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 a package of grants and subsidies designed to promote green growth and jobs. Stiglitz said the battle against global heating would only be won if poor countries were onboard but there was no hope of them coming up with their equivalent of the act, which he said was expensive and flawed but working. Instead, he said rich countries should support the creation of $300bn of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) each year to finance a global green transition. The US economist admitted it would be impossible to get his plan through the US Congress in its current deadlocked state but said he would continue to campaign for it. \u201cAs the scale of climate change impresses itself more and more on us, we are going to need bolder things. When the time comes and we are frying and somebody says: \u2018How do we get out of the frying pan?\u2019, this [annual SDR allocations] is one way of doing so.\u201d The need for extra money to help poorer countries cope with the effects of global heating and decarbonise their economies has been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, in Morocco this week. Stiglitz, a former World Bank chief economist, said he welcomed plans to provide the bank with more capital to lend for green projects but said a far more ambitious approach was needed. SDRs are an accepted international reserve asset that can be exchanged with hard currencies and can be used as a credit line. Seen as a form of money creation similar to quantitative easing, the IMF issued a $650bn tranche of SDRs in 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Rich countries did not need to use their allocations and agreed to recycle some of their SDRs into special IMF funds to support poor nations. Stiglitz said of SDRs: \u201cBasically, it is printing money. It wouldn\u2019t be inflationary but it would be transformative.\u201d He said the EU was planning its own version of the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 but on a smaller scale. \u201cDeveloping countries can\u2019t do it on any scale. Unless developing countries and emerging markets reduce their emissions, no matter what pieties we do in the US and Europe, we will get global warming. The rhetoric is about doing something about climate change and then rather than getting onboard [the people] you most need to get onboard, you alienate them.\u201d The act was originally sold by the US president, Joe Biden, as a $370bn plan to rebuild the country\u2019s industrial base by boosting investment in projects designed to achieve net zero. Stiglitz said the actual size of the stimulus could turn out to be $1.5tn. \u201cIt is an open-ended tax credit. The good thing is that we are getting a lot of green investment.\u201d Stiglitz said he supported the act even though it was poorly designed and included some \u201cmassively protectionist\u201d measures that violated international rules.

They have provided guidance on everything from hydropower dam construction in Nepal to farm diversification in Ethiopia. Alongside private consultancies, the UK\u2019s climate finance is also spent via large international bodies such as the World Bank, UN agencies, development banks and NGOs. Much of the money administered by these groups goes directly to projects, although all of them take cuts along the way to pay for staff and other expenses.

This time, the creature is a caterpillar, its pale green body blending with the grass \u2013 and it is setting one hell of a pace as it traverses the bare earth. Now, its colouring and extravagant white fluff stands out. Four buff tufts sprout from its back, and a pinky red tail of hairs reaching up from its rear like a flag. As it flexes, it flashes black. As it flexes, it flashes black. I resist the urge to put out my hand and invite this pale tussock moth larva to crawl over my skin. They can cause severe allergic reactions. Pickers of hops \u2013 one of the caterpillars\u2019 food plants \u2013 used to call them \u201chop dogs\u201d, and there is something curiously dog-like in the way they move, as if following a scent.

A nearby hum reminds me that I\u2019m approaching the hornets\u2019 nest in a hollow tree, cordoned off to save walkers from a fright. A constant stream of chestnut-coloured European hornets (Vespa crabro) whiz in and out of the hole \u2013 I\u2019m surprised the nest is still so active. At this time of year it is dying, with the males, old queen and workers reaching the end of their lives. Females that will become new queens are filling up on nectar, ready to hibernate. Despite their large size, hornets are not as aggressive as wasps, but they would defend their nest site. Seeing one hornet is often a shock, and seeing several together really should instil respect. But I\u2019m a fool. I\u2019d like a photo for this article. I climb under the rope fence for a better view. Almost instantly, a hornet buzzes close to my ear. It\u2019s loud. I take a hasty photo but it\u2019s rubbish. Maybe if I go forward a bit? Maybe if I go forward a bit? I take one more step and a hornet bumps my shoulder, then flies back to the nest. It probably didn\u2019t see me. But I am soon nudged again, this time on my cheek, and I can be in no doubt that I\u2019m being politely but firmly warned.

It\u2019s a price worth paying  Gianluca Grimalda is still waiting in Bougainville for a cargo ship, set to depart on Saturday, to begin his return journey to Europe, after six months investigating the impacts of climate breakdown and globalisation on the island\u2019s inhabitants. Grimalda, who has avoided flying for more than a decade, said he had promised the people he met during his field work \u2013 some of whom had been displaced by rising waters \u2013 he would minimise his carbon emissions on his return journey. But he faced a dilemma two weeks ago when his bosses at the Kiel Institute for Worldwide Economy (IfW) gave him a deadline to return to his desk that meant he had to travel by air, or face losing his job. He refused and on Wednesday, he said they informed him his contract had been terminated. \u201cIfW seems to ignore that we have entered the Anthropocene era and that the most important Earth ecosystems are close to collapse, if not already collapsed,\u201d Grimalda said. \u201cIn this era, wasting 4.5 tonnes of CO2 (the difference between the flight emissions and the slow-travel emissions) to comply with the absurd request to be physically present in Kiel at such short notice is morally unacceptable and epitomises the ultimate privilege of the global elites. \u201cIt is the sign that IfW is still living in an era that will be wiped out by the incoming climate collapses.\u201d Writing in the Guardian\u2019s opinion section on Thursday, Grimalda said the carbon that would be emitted by his one-way flight to Europe from Solomon Islands archipelago is more than the average person living there uses in an entire year. Grimalda said he intended to appeal against the IfW\u2019s decision to sack him, and said he had asked for the help of his trade union. But, he added: \u201cIn this case, the initial impression is that IfW actions are justified legally.\u201d A spokesperson for IfW said that it stood by its policy of not discussing or commenting on staff issues in public. \u201cIn general, the institute encourages and supports its staff to travel climate-friendly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe are committed to do without air travel in Germany and in other EU countries as far as we can. When flights are unavoidable, we pay to Atmosfair to offset flight emissions through climate protection projects. \u201cWhat is public and obvious: Dr Grimalda planned his trip to Papua and his research stay with our support. We supported a second \u2018slow travel\u2019 trip of his before. So we have no general reservations about slow travelling.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2023.

Rowing back on policies to phase out gas boilers and petrol and diesel vehicles, and the general sense that the government is \u201cweakening its commitments\u201d to shifting to a green economy, have also harmed the prospects of inward investment into the UK, and sent adverse signals to consumers, businesses and other governments. Scrapping plans to force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented accommodation will also cost renters about \u00a3325 a year in higher bills, the report found. In a damning verdict on the prime minister\u2019s announcements last month, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) warned of a \u201csubstantial policy gap\u201d that was putting the UK off track to meet its crucial 2030 carbon targets. Piers Forster, the acting chair of the CCC, said: \u201cThe prime minister has relaxed important policies to decarbonise buildings and transport and sent a message to business and the international audience that he will allow more time for the UK to transition to key clean technologies.\u201d He added: \u201cWe remain concerned about the likelihood of achieving the UK\u2019s future targets, especially the substantial policy gap to the UK\u2019s 2030 goals.\u201d The CCC found there were \u201cinsufficient\u201d plans to meet about a fifth of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to hit the government\u2019s international goal of cutting carbon by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Renewable energy is another source of concern, as no contracts were awarded at the last auction for offshore wind developments last month, as wind companies turned away from the UK. Labour has said that if elected it would restore some of the previous policies, such as the former 2030 deadline for phasing out fossil fuel cars, but there are question marks over the proposed phase-out date for gas boilers. But Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for net zero, told the Guardian that Labour would commit to stringent action on emissions and investment in green growth, which he has said are the only way to tackle the cost of living crisis. He said: \u201cThis is damning evidence from the government\u2019s own watchdog that Rishi Sunak\u2019s decisions to force renters to live in damp homes and delay the transition to electric vehicles will increase costs for families across Britain. This report also confirms that this government is seriously off track to meet its climate targets, storing up costs and damage for future generations. The Conservatives have no solution to the cost of living crisis, and Rishi Sunak is only raising bills and making Britain more insecure.\u201d The statutory adviser\u2019s assessment of Sunak\u2019s U-turns, published on Wednesday, also criticised the government\u2019s \u201cunhelpful\u201d failure to make any estimates of the likely impacts of the policy changes on the UK\u2019s ability to meet its legally binding carbon budgets, and to provide essential detail on the changes. There were a few words of praise amid the criticism, for instance over the government\u2019s support for electrification of the steel industry at Port Talbot, and the decision to retain a 2030 target for 80% of new vehicles sold to be electric, despite postponing the phase-out of sales of new fossil fuel cars by five years to 2035. Ministers also set out measures that would raise the price for carbon emissions under the UK\u2019s emissions trading scheme, which the CCC said would have a positive effect, though it was \u201cat the looser end\u201d of the possible range. Forster also noted that the government\u2019s actions would have an impact on Cop28, the crucial UN climate summit that begins late next month. \u201cOur position as a global leader on climate has come under renewed scrutiny following the prime minister\u2019s speech. We urge the government to restate strong British leadership on climate change in the crucial period before the next climate summit, Cop28 in Dubai,\u201d he said. Green experts and campaigners called for Sunak to change his stance. Danny Gross, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis assessment highlights the glaring inconsistencies between the government\u2019s rhetoric and action. Rishi Sunak has said he will honour his commitment, made at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, to cut the UK\u2019s carbon emissions by over two-thirds by 2030. His climate advisers are telling him loud and clear that his plans just don\u2019t add up and the target will be missed.\u201d He added: \u201cThe prime minister is scrapping policies that would reduce harmful emissions and cut sky-high energy bills. He claims his government will be one of integrity, so he should stop trying to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes by pretending he can deliver on promises with a climate plan that\u2019s just not up to scratch.\u201d Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said Sunak\u2019s policy rollbacks had left the UK more dependent on imported oil and gas, and that the failure of the offshore wind auction would mean people\u2019s energy bills would be \u00a31bn higher than necessary. She added that there was damaging lack of clarity over many of the policies. \u201cBy failing to prepare for off-gas grid boiler phase-out \u2013 a policy that would have affected 0.2% of homes a year from 2026 \u2013 the seeds of confusion are sowed not only with homeowners but with investors too who are seeking to build new, clean industries as the UK tries to compete in the global race for green growth,\u201d she said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK remains a global leader on climate \u2013 cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country \u2013 so we are confident that we will meet our future carbon commitments, including net zero, just as we have overdelivered on every carbon target to date. We are taking a fairer and more pragmatic approach to meeting net zero that eases burdens on families \u2013 saving households up to \u00a315,000 on upfront costs to upgrade their homes. \u201cWe will continue to meet our international commitments under the Paris agreement, while embracing the opportunities of clean industries \u2013 supporting thousands of British jobs, driving economic growth \u2013 while protecting national security and bringing down energy bills in the long term.\u201d ",

In Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK, authorities have responded to climate protests with mass arrests, the passing of draconian new laws, the imposing of severe sentences for non-violent protests and the labelling of activists as hooligans, saboteurs or eco-terrorists. The crackdowns have come in spite of calls by senior human rights advocates and environmental campaigners to allow civic space for the right to non-violent protest, after a summer of record-breaking heat in southern Europe that is attributed to the effects of climate breakdown. The UK has led the way in the crackdown, experts say, with judges recently refusing an appeal against multi-year sentences for climate activists who blocked a motorway bridge in east London. The three-year jail terms for Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland earlier this year are thought to be the longest handed out by a British judge for non-violent protest. The ruling came as protesters in the UK try to navigate a new legal environment that includes significant limits on the right to protest, including two wide-ranging new laws passed in the past two years giving police the discretion to ban protests regarded as \u201cdisruptive\u201d and criminalising a host of protest tactics. Michel Forst, the UN rapporteur on environmental defenders since June last year, described the situation in the UK as \u201cterrifying\u201d. He added that other countries were \u201clooking at the UK examples with a view to passing similar laws in their own countries, which will have a devastating effect for Europe\u201d. \u201cSince my appointment I have been travelling to many countries in Europe and there is a clear trend,\u201d Forst told the Guardian. \u201cWe can see an increasing number of cases by which these climate activists are brought to court more and more often and more and more severe laws being passed to facilitate these attacks on defenders.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m sure that there is European cooperation among the police forces against these kinds of activities. My concern is that when [governments] are calling these people eco-terrorists, or are using new forms of vilifications and defamation \u2026 it has a huge impact on how the population may perceive them and the cause for which these people are fighting. It is a huge concern for me.\u201d Amnesty International said it was investigating a continent-wide crackdown on protest. Catrinel Motoc, the organisation\u2019s senior campaigner on civil space and right to protest in Europe, said: \u201cPeople all around the world are bravely raising their voices to call for urgent actions on the climate crisis but many face dire consequences for their peaceful activism. \u201cPeaceful protesters are left with no choice but to stage public protests and non-violent direct actions because European countries are not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s alarming evidence of criminalisation, harassment, stigmatisation and negative rhetoric towards environmental defenders.\u201d Motoc said that instead of demonising and restricting peaceful environmental defenders, \u201cEuropean governments should put [their] energy into open dialogue with activists and organisations to fix the problems of climate crisis. Climate protesters are not a nuisance, and they should not be silenced or crushed.\u201d In June, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, also called for an end to crackdowns on environmental activists. Last December, Volker T\u00fcrk, the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, appealed to governments to protect the \u201ccivic space\u201d for young environmental activists, and \u201cnot crack down in a way that we have seen in many parts of the world\u201d. There was widespread outrage this summer when France\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, used one of the state\u2019s most-powerful tools to order the banning of one of the country\u2019s leading environmental protest groups. Les Soul\u00e9vements de la Terre, a collective of local environmental campaigns, had staged a series of protests, with tactics including sabotage, that ended with violent confrontations with police, and Darmanin denouncing the activists as \u201cfar left\u201d and \u201cecoterrorists\u201d. In the Netherlands, one of a series of roadblock protests on the A12 highway in The Hague in May was dispersed by police using water cannon, with more than 1,500 arrested. Seven climate activists were convicted of sedition \u2013 a charge that had never before been levelled against climate protesters \u2013 in relation to online posts calling for people to join an earlier demonstration. In Sweden, about two dozen members of the \u00c5terst\u00e4ll V\u00e5tmarker [Restore Wetlands] group were convicted of sabotage for blocking highways in the capital, Stockholm. Others were held on remand for up to four weeks for taking part in protests. In Germany in May, police staged nationwide raids against the Letzte Generation (Last Generation) group, whose supporters had glued themselves to roads on a near-weekly basis for months, as well as targeting art galleries and other cultural spaces. On a police directive, the homepage of the group was shut down and possessions belonging to members were seized. At the most recent count, supplied by the activists, police had made more than 4,000 arrests of supporters of Last Generation taking part in road blocks in Berlin alone. Authorities in Italy have used anti-organised crime laws to crack down on protests, where the Ultima Generazione (also Last Generation) group has staged road blocks since last year. The Digos police unit, which specialises in counter-terrorism, in April justified the use of anti-Mafia laws to target the group by saying its civil disobedience actions had not taken place spontaneously, but were organised, discussed and weighed up by an internal hierarchy. This came along with new, stiffer penalties for protests, with activists facing fines of up to \u20ac40,000 for actions targeting artworks and other cultural heritage. Richard Pearshouse, director of the environment division at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThese restrictions on environmental protest across Europe and the UK are incredibly short-sighted. These governments haven\u2019t grasped that we all have a huge interest in more people taking to the streets to demand better environmental protection and more climate action. \u201cGovernments need to respect the rights to assembly and expression, and ramp up their own environmental protections and climate ambitions. That\u2019s the only way we have a chance to get out of this climate crisis with our democratic institutions intact.\u201d A spokesperson for the UK Home Office said: \u201cThe right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority\u2019s right to go about their daily lives. \u201cThe Public Order Act brings in new criminal offences and proper penalties for selfish, guerrilla protest tactics.\u201d The French interior ministry said local officials had the right to ban demonstrations with a serious risk of disturbing public order. \u201cThese one-off bans, of which there are very few in absolute terms, are not imposed because of the reason for the demonstration.\u201dThe Italian interior ministry referred to a statement from the culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano in April, who said attacks on monuments cause economic damage to the community that is is expensive to clean up. \u201cThose who cause damage must pay personally.\u201dThe German interior ministry declined to comment. The Bavarian interior ministry referred the Guardian to the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Munich, which provided a statement from June in which it confirmed it had authorised the tapping of phones for six of seven Last Generation members under criminal investigation.  The Swedish interior ministry declined to comment. The Dutch ministry of justice did not respond to requests for comment. ",

            "text": "Experts and campaigners who focus on human rights have raised concerns about a growing crackdown on climate protests in Europe. The Guardian conducted research that found countries across the continent using harsh measures to silence activists. In Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the UK, authorities have responded to climate protests by making mass arrests, passing strict new laws, handing out severe sentences for non-violent protests, and labeling activists as hooligans, saboteurs, or eco-terrorists. Despite calls from senior human rights advocates and environmental campaigners to allow peaceful protests, these crackdowns have continued. This comes after a summer of record-breaking heat in southern Europe that is believed to be caused by climate change.\n\nThe UK has been particularly strict, with judges recently refusing an appeal against multi-year sentences for climate activists who blocked a motorway bridge in east London. These three-year jail terms for Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland are thought to be the longest given by a British judge for non-violent protest. The UK has also passed two new laws in the past two years that give the police the power to ban \"disruptive\" protests and criminalize various protest tactics. Michel Forst, the UN rapporteur on environmental defenders, described the situation in the UK as \"terrifying\" and noted that other countries were looking at the UK as an example to pass similar laws.\n\nAmnesty International is currently investigating the crackdown on protests across Europe. Catrinel Motoc, a senior campaigner at Amnesty International, said that peaceful activists are facing criminalization, harassment, stigmatization, and negative rhetoric. Motoc argues that instead of demonizing and restricting peaceful environmental defenders, European governments should engage in open dialogue with activists and organizations to address the climate crisis.\n\nIn June, the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights called for an end to crackdowns on environmental activists. Last December, the UN's high commissioner for human rights also appealed to governments to protect the civic space for young environmental activists.

            "text": "As wildfires and extreme temperatures rage across the planet, sea temperature records tumble and polar glaciers disappear, the scale and speed of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore. Scientific experts are unanimous that there needs to be an urgent clampdown on fossil fuel production, a major boost in renewable energy and support for communities to rapidly move towards a fairer, healthier and sustainable low-carbon future. Many governments, however, seem to have different priorities. According to climate experts, senior figures at the UN and grassroots advocates contacted by the Guardian, some political leaders and law enforcement agencies around the world are instead launching a fierce crackdown on people trying to peacefully raise the alarm. \u201cThese defenders are basically trying to save the planet, and in doing so save humanity,\u201d said Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders. \u201cThese are people we should be protecting, but are seen by governments and corporations as a threat to be neutralised. In the end it\u2019s about power and economics.\u201d Climate and environmental justice groups report a significant increase in draconian, and often arbitrary, charges for peaceful protesters as part of what they claim is a playbook of tactics to vilify, discredit, intimidate and silence activists. The Guardian has also found striking similarities in the way governments from Canada and the US to Guatemala and Chile, from India and Tanzania to the UK, Europe and Australia, are cracking down on activists trying to protect the planet. The legal contexts vary, but the charges \u2013 such as subversion, illicit association, terrorism and tax evasion \u2013 are often vague and time-consuming to disprove, while a growing number of countries, including the US and UK, have passed controversial anti-protest laws ostensibly intended to protect national security or so-called critical infrastructure such as fossil fuel pipelines. The systematic criminalisation of environmental defenders is not new. Natural resources on Indigenous land have long been exploited, driving big profits for some but also fuelling violence and inequality.  Experts say the Marlin mine in Guatemala was one of the earliest documented cases of a transnational corporation \u2013 and its state allies \u2013 weaponising the legal system against environmental defenders. Since then, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned what it describes as the alarming rise in the misuse of criminal justice systems against environmental, land and other human rights defenders across Latin America. \u201cCriminalising defenders encourages collective stigma and sends off an intimidating message,\u201d the IACHR said last year. According to Lawlor, this criminalisation of environmental protestors has since become a global phenomenon, and is now the most common tactic used to silence and discredit defenders. \u201cAt its core it\u2019s about maintaining the power structures in place. This is true regardless of whether it\u2019s a dictatorship, democracy or a corrupt narco state, and regardless of the state\u2019s professed commitment to human rights, protecting the environment and combating climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cSmearing defenders as lawbreakers or anti-development distracts from the cause and changes the narrative \u2026 What\u2019s clear is that states learn from each other.\u201d Climate activism is well and truly back. Paolo Gerbaudo, an academic at King\u2019s College London who studies social movements, said that before the 2008 financial crash, the climate emergency felt like \u201cthe challenge of our time\u201d. But it \u201clargely slipped off the social and political agenda\u201d as activists such as Occupy turned their attention to opposing austerity policies and pushing for global economic reforms. As scientific warnings grew ever more dire during the 2010s, there was a deepening feeling that traditional environmental campaigning was failing, and that politicians were not delivering \u2013 with potentially catastrophic consequences. It was into this context that more direct action, and more radical environmental protest groups emerged. Over the past five years, the UK has been not only at the forefront of these new forms of non-violent activism, but also novel means of silencing it. In 2019, Extinction Rebellion paralysed London traffic for days with an unprecedented carnival of climate protest, then the following year turned their attention on the press with blockades of newspaper printing sites. In 2021, as Covid pandemic restrictions lifted, Insulate Britain pioneered the tactic of disruptive roadblocks with small groups, polarising the public but forcing home insulation on to the political agenda. Just Stop Oil expanded those tactics last year, turning them on to the UK\u2019s oil infrastructure, and widening their targets to a series of headline-grabbing protests at sporting and cultural events. New groups have since sprung up in Canada, Australia, the US, Italy and Germany \u2013 such as the Sunrise Movement, Climate Defiance, Fridays for Future, Last Generation and the Tyre Extinguishers  \u2013 which imitate the non-violent but disruptive tactics of Insulate Britain, picking a single demand and protesting until it is met or the activists are jailed. The focus and methods vary, from disrupting shareholder meetings, sit-ins and roadblocks to damaging artwork and SUVs, and confronting politicians and academics with fossil fuel ties at their homes and workplaces. There are also examples of grassroots opposition to fossil fuel pipelines, mines, petrochemical plants and other polluting projects ballooning into global movements, such as the 2016 Dakota Access pipeline protests on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Protests against multinational banks financing the East African crude oil pipeline (EACOP), which threatens to pollute vital water sources and displace thousands of families and farmers in Uganda and Tanzania, have taken place in around 20 countries. But as such protests have become more direct, organised and disruptive \u2013 which activists say reflects the urgency of the situation \u2013 states have responded increasingly aggressively. Gerbaudo said repression against climate activists was growing: \u201cPunishment for collective actions is becoming ever more draconian, as a means to discourage them and criminalise them \u2026\u2026 This is a testament to the way in which the political class, while having few practical responses in store to the demands of social movements, all too often resorts to simply repressing these very demands and the groups and individuals voicing them.\u201d In Australia, Human Rights Watch has found that the authorities \u201care disproportionately punishing climate protesters in violation of their basic rights to peaceful protest\u201d. Several states, including Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria, have passed or are trying to pass laws that can punish peaceful environmental protesters with hefty fines and jail time. The laws are accompanied by an expansion in the discretionary powers available to police such as on-the-spot fines and onerous bail conditions. In the US, 21 states have passed critical infrastructure protection laws since the Standing Rock protests, and dozens of activists have been arrested and/or charged in the past five years. Many of the states\u2019 legislation shares language drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing group funded by fossil fuel companies. In the UK, after the surge in protests in 2019, rightwing opinion formers were aghast at the perceived breakdown in public order and the Conservative government responded with a plethora of new police powers to tackle what it called the \u201cguerrilla protest tactics\u201d of the new climate movement. The 300-page Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 significantly increased the power of the state to regulate protest and activism. Police were given extensive new powers to ban non-violent protests considered too noisy or disruptive \u2013 with the definition of disruption left up to the government to decide. Penalties for obstructing the highway \u2013 a key tactic of XR and its offshoots \u2013 were increased to potentially unlimited fines and six-month prison sentences, even if police had already closed the road. A new statutory offence of causing a public nuisance was also created \u2013 replacing its old common law equivalent and specifically targetting protests \u2013 with offenders facing potential 10-year jail sentences. The legislation followed a report by the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange entitled Extremism Rebellion. It claimed that non-violent environmental campaigners and campaigns could stray into terrorism, and called for new laws to curtail them. The government adopted its proposals in the new act. Investigative journalists later reported that Policy Exchange had previously received funding from energy interests including ExxonMobil, Drax and Energy UK. Amnesty described the passage of the \u201cdeeply authoritarian\u201d act as a \u201cdark day for civil liberties in the UK\u201d, but the ink had barely dried on the statute books when the government followed it up with a second anti-protest law. The Public Order Act, passed by parliament earlier this year, includes orders that can ban named individuals from joining protests, and an expansion of police powers to stop and search people on the grounds they might be planning to commit a protest-related offence \u2013 including many newly created by the bill \u2013 as well as powers for \u201csuspicionless\u201d searches. It also created new offences of \u201clocking on\u201d, where protesters chain or glue themselves to immovable objects or each other, going to protests equipped to lock on, obstructing major transport works, interfering with national infrastructure and tunnelling \u2013 all tactics used by climate activists. Restrictions have been placed on defendants in a series of trials that prevented them from mentioning the climate crisis, insulation, fuel poverty or their motivations as part of their defence. David Armiak, the research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, said the new UK and US legislation was \u201cpart of a last-ditch, industry-backed effort to protect its profit model in the face of public demands to turn to renewables and divest from fossil fuels as the climate emergency intensifies\u201d. \u201cIt is likely not a coincidence that Policy Exchange and Alec have both been members of the Atlas Network, a global network of rightwing non-profits successfully pushing an anti-regulation, pro-corporate policy agenda worldwide that is fuelled with cash from Charles Koch, Exxon and dark money conduits.\u201d Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders, said: \u201cWhat is happening in the UK is really terrifying. What can people do against these new laws that have been introduced? What are they supposed to do? \u201cYou can see some countries are looking at the UK examples with a view to passing similar laws in their own countries, which will have a devastating effect for Europe.\u201d He said there seemed to be coordinated state action from Germany to Italy and from Spain to Denmark to penalise and crack down on protesters, and that he had seen growing anxiety and stress among young climate activists and lawyers across the continent first hand.  \u201cIt has clearly had a chilling effect \u2026 My concern is that there is no clear response from the international community on what\u2019s happening in our countries,\u201d he said. Lawlor said: \u201cCriminalisation is the most common tactic used against human rights defenders, because it\u2019s so easy and has such a big impact.\u201d Authorities in Germany launched an organised crime investigation into Letze Generation or Last Generation, part of the same transnational A22 climate activist network as Just Stop Oil, after months of disruptive protests by the group. They responded to the group\u2019s repeated roadblocks and direct action by launching dawn raids on its members\u2019 homes and wiretapping their phones and shutting down its website.  Italy also used anti-mafia laws to target its own A22 affiliate, Ultima Generazione, also Last Generation, mobilising its Digos counter-terrorism unit to investigate the group. After a string of actions around the country\u2019s ancient cultural icons, the government passed a law in July bringing in fines of up to \u20ac40,000 (\u00a335,000) for protesters who deface or damage monuments. Police in the Netherlands detained nearly 3,000 climate protesters in a single weekend this summer after they blocked the A12 highway through The Hague. Police turned water cannon on the 10,000 who joined the protest, some of them in swimwear in expectation of the tactic. It was a repeat of a similar episode in May, when 1,500 people were arrested in a single day for blocking the same road. In August, seven supporters were convicted of sedition for calling on people to join a protest on the A12 in March.  Similarly heavy charges have been levelled against Sweden\u2019s A22 affiliate, \u00c5terst\u00e4ll V\u00e5tmarker, or Restore Wetlands. The group said members had been held in prison for five weeks after their first week of action last year. As many as 25 have since been convicted of sabotage for taking part in roadblock protests in Stockholm. \u201cThere are 14 people in jail at the moment for putting a little bit of peat in a ditch,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesperson said in early August. But it is France, a country with longstanding tensions between the state and civil society, where some of the harshest measures have been taken against environmental protests. In June, the country\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, took the radical step of using a law drafted to tackle extremist groups to outlaw one of the country\u2019s most popular environmental protest groups, Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre, or Earth\u2019s Uprisings. The group had emerged as a significant and novel force in environmental campaigning, but its use of tactics including sabotage put it on a collision course with the French state. Darmanin has denounced its supporters as \u201cecoterrorists\u201d. Overall, governments have claimed that new laws and harsher penalties are necessary to protect energy infrastructure and deter increasingly disruptive protests. A spokesperson for the UK Home Office said: \u201cThe right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority\u2019s right to go about their daily lives. \u201cThe Public Order Act brings in new criminal offences and proper penalties for selfish, guerrilla protest tactics.\u201d The French interior ministry said local officials had the right to ban demonstrations that posed a serious risk of disturbing public order. \u201cThese one-off bans, of which there are very few in absolute terms, are not imposed because of the reason for the demonstration,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Italian interior ministry referred to a statement from the culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, in April, when he said attacks on monuments caused economic damage to the community that were expensive to clean up. \u201cThose who cause damage must pay personally,\u201d he said.The German interior ministry declined to comment. The Bavarian interior ministry referred the Guardian to the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Munich, which provided a statement from June in which it confirmed it had authorised the tapping of phones for six of seven Last Generation members under criminal investigation.  The Swedish interior ministry declined to comment. The Dutch ministry of justice did not respond to requests for comment. Criminalisation does not happen in isolation. Experts say that deploying the legal system is part of a spectrum or playbook of escalating tactics deployed by corporations and their allies to divide communities, distract leaders and weaken social movements. The tactics reported by activists include online attacks, defamation, police surveillance, security deployments and violence. In the southern US state of Georgia, the environmental activist Manuel Esteban P\u00e1ez Ter\u00e1n was shot dead by Atlanta police during the state\u2019s crackdown on protesters opposing the construction of a sprawling police and fire training centre that will partially destroy a city forest. No officers have been charged in relation to the killing, but dozens of activists face domestic terrorism charges with bond conditions banning communication between them. In India, environmental and other human rights defenders have faced increasingly hostile and dangerous conditions under the Hindu fundamentalist government of Narendra Modi. In the state of Tamil Nadu, police have been accused of excessive force and instigating violence against protesters opposing the expansion of a vast copper smelting plant, which in 2018 resulted in 13 deaths. Activists and NGOs in India also face arbitrary criminal charges, surveillance and frozen bank accounts, creating a \u201cchilling effect on civil society\u201d, according to Global Witness. A crackdown on environmental, land and climate activists \u2013 and journalists \u2013 has been documented in African countries including Mozambique, Cameroon and Egypt, as the so-called western \u201cdash for African gas\u201d has intensified in the wake of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. There are also reports of arrests, land grabs and violence against community leaders and NGOs campaigning against the 900-mile EACOP, which scientists say will generate 379m tons of climate-heating emissions. Lawlor said land, environment and Indigenous rights defenders accounted for about 70% of killings of human rights activists every year. \u201cThey are a priority for me,\u201d she said. \u201cMost countries are talking out of both sides of their mouth. On the one hand, they say they support the fight against climate change, and they want to bring down emissions and they want to protect the environment. And on the other hand, they\u2019re just allowing companies to come in and give them licences, even though the rights that these people are trying to defend are protected in international law. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a lack of determination by states to treat climate change like a crisis. There\u2019s a total disconnect and it\u2019s all very murky.\u201d Latin America is the deadliest region for environmental and land defenders, according to a decade of data collated by Global Witness. In Brazil, the Indigenous rights expert Bruno Pereira and the Guardian journalist Dom Phillips were murdered last year while investigating illegal fishing and mining in the Amazon. A Guardian investigation also found that at least two dozen environmental defenders had been murdered, disappeared or jailed in Mexico and Central America in the first three months of 2023, with governments in the region widely condemned for indirect violence by licensing extractive projects without consulting communities and failing to prosecute perpetrators. Shin Imai from the Justice and Corporate Accountability Project (JCAP) \u2013 an Ontario-based legal clinic that helps communities affected by natural resource extraction hold Canadian corporations and states to account \u2013 said the criminalisation of environmental activists was particularly chilling because it exposed the symbiotic relationship between polluting corporations and governments. \u201cThere is very clearly an international pattern to criminalise communities in which the nexus between corporations and governments is very important \u2026 mining and fossil fuel companies need the [host] state to criminalise defenders, and also often rely on their own government to use diplomatic influence to pressure the host state to deploy troops, pass laws, arrest activists and deny bail,\u201d said Imai, an emeritus professor at the Osgoode Hall law school in Toronto. In other words, Shin said, acts of violence, online attacks, threats and other intimidatory tactics could be carried out against activists without state involvement, but criminalisation required lawmakers, prosecutors, police and courts to be involved \u2013 the same people and agencies we need to tackle the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. \u201cAcross the world, the legal goal posts are being changed to make criminalising climate and environmental defenders easier in a way that violates fundamental rights and the spirit of the rule of law,\u201d he said.  No major fossil fuel executive is known to have been detained for their role in the climate emergency, but UN experts, lawyers and activists have documented hundreds of environmental activists being arrested and charged for peacefully protesting to save the planet. And their time is running out. That was the stark conclusion in this year\u2019s landmark IPCC report: \u201cThere is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\u201d It is clear that communities on the frontline of the climate crisis know this, because they are the ones dying and losing their homes and livelihoods as a result of sea-level rise, erratic rainfall patterns and scorching temperatures. It is why campaign groups and activists across the world say they are taking direct action against extractive projects by targeting fossil fuel, mining and petrochemical companies and their enablers such as banks, private equity funds and politicians through direct and sometimes disruptive action, despite the risk to their freedom and their lives. As the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in April: \u201cClimate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\u201d The climate crisis is exposing and aggravating economic, political and racial inequalities, but eventually the hotter planet will affect everyone, everywhere. Environmental and climate activists are trying to force governments and corporations to put humanity before profits and power, which is why Lawlor and Forst say arresting Indigenous land defenders in Canada, Greta Thunberg in Sweden, clean energy advocates in Vietnam and water protectors in Guatemala and Honduras are all connected, part of the same fossil fuel playbook to block and delay meaningful action. This is a dangerous moment globally, says Jorge Santos, the director of a Guatemala-based watchdog that monitors attacks against human rights defenders. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the endless extraction of natural resources, the environmental and climate destruction will continue, and we\u2019ll see more and more authoritarianism because criminalisation and violence is in the DNA of this economic model.\u201d \u2022 Over the course of the next few months, the Guardian will be reporting on the criminalisation of climate and environmental activists globally.

            "text": "Severe policing and \u201cscary\u201d political rhetoric is fuelling abuse against climate activists, Germany\u2019s best-known environmentalist has said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a shift any more, it\u2019s a slide,\u201d said Luisa Neubauer, from the German branch of Fridays for Future, the protest movement that grew out of Greta Thunberg\u2019s school strikes. \u201cThere\u2019s an increase in hate language, there\u2019s an increase in threats, and the threats are getting more concrete. So they\u2019re not saying any more \u2018I hate you\u2019 but they\u2019re saying \u2018We should come to your place, we should go get you.\u2019\u201d Germany has increasingly cracked down on climate protests as they have grown more disruptive, with police using laws designed to fight organised crime to tap phones, raid homes, freeze bank accounts and place activists in preventive detention. In September, the human rights group Amnesty International added Germany to a list of countries where the state was restricting the public\u2019s right to protest. \u201cThe shift that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 the sliding of societal normality \u2013 that is not just something that has to do with laws and police presence,\u201d said Neubauer. \u201cThis is something to do with rhetoric that has been taken over in almost the entire democratic party spectrum in Germany.\u201d A government spokesperson said Amnesty was wrong to include Germany in its map and that protest was always possible, but must be within the framework of the law. They said: \u201cFrom our point of view, engagement in climate protection should unite us as a society, not divide us.\u201d Activists argue it is the increasingly extreme rhetoric from mainstream political parties that is doing just that. Senior politicians in Germany have compared Last Generation, a nonviolent protest group that has blockaded motorways and thrown paint on glass-covered artworks, to terrorist organisations such as the Red Army Faction, a far-left group that killed dozens of people in the 1970s and 80s. Earlier this year, in tweets that have since been deleted, politicians from the centre-left and centre-right parties drew links between Last Generation and the Taliban. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has described the protests as \u201ccompletely idiotic\u201d, appeared to compare climate activists to Nazis last year after two people disrupted a panel at which he was speaking in Stuttgart. \u201cLet me say frankly, these black-clad spectacles at different events, always by the same people, remind me of a time that lies long in the past \u2013 and thank God for that,\u201d he said, to loud applause. Scholz and his team denied he was referring to the Nazis in interviews and press conferences over the days that followed, but refused to say which other black-clad group from history he could have meant. When asked again by the Guardian whom Scholz had meant, the government spokesperson referred to a previous statement from a colleague who had said \u201cthe chancellor\u2019s comments stand for themselves\u201d. Neubauer, who criticised Scholz\u2019s comparison at the time, said his language had changed the way people saw activists. \u201cHe is the leader of the country. People read his remarks \u2026 and suddenly feel a complete new ownership, accusing me and making threats against activists like me and others,\u201d she said. A member of Neubauer\u2019s security detail agreed with her assessment that threats against her had grown more common and concrete. The security guard shared an internal report compiled the week after the event in Stuttgart that documented \u201cvery many hate comments\u201d, some violent and threatening, in particular under articles about Scholz. \u201cThere were often comments that Scholz was right and they [climate activists] were like the \u2018Sturmabteilung\u2019, \u2018fascists\u2019 or \u2018climate terrorists\u2019,\u201d the report found. The threats have grown to a point where Neubauer, a 27-year-old geography student, goes to lectures with a bodyguard. She said she had to decline a recent request to sign an open letter in support of asylum seekers \u201cbecause I knew that weekend my security guards were on a break\u201d. The hate is \u201c99.9% from men\u201d, she added. \u201cThey had websites open where people would fantasise about how best to rape me.\u201d There was a broad swell of support in Germany for the climate movement in 2019 as Fridays for Future protests sprang up across the country. But public opinion has soured as protesters from Last Generation, who want to raise the level of urgency and put more pressure on politicians, have turned to disruptive stunts that are more likely to grab headlines and get people talking about the climate crisis. A study from More in Common, a nonprofit pushing for social cohesion, found that general support for the climate movement in Germany has fallen from 68% to 34% in the last two years. The share of people who agreed that the climate movement has \u201cthe wellbeing of all of society in mind\u201d fell from 60% to 25%. Neubauer said there were initially lively debates within Fridays for Future about how closely to align with Last Generation, \u201cbut now after one and a half years with nothing but a political backlash this is really changing. People are worried there\u2019s no strategy to counter the backlash.\u201d Activists from both groups say they have grown frustrated with the slow pace of change and the government\u2019s lack of respect for its own climate legislation. In 2021, Germany\u2019s top court declared the country\u2019s climate law \u201cpartly unconstitutional\u201d after Neubauer and other activists argued it violated their human rights. The government strengthened the law with tougher targets for each sector of the economy. Ministers were ordered to come up with an \u201cimmediate action plan\u201d if they failed to meet their targets.  Related: How Germany, France and Italy compare on net zero emission targets  But since then, sectors such as transport and buildings have seen little consequence for failing to cut pollution as fast as the law requires. The government\u2019s scientific watchdog declared the transport minister\u2019s latest action plan too weak to qualify for a full analysis, while the environment agency said its planned measures would \u201cbarely\u201d narrow the gap between projected emissions and targets. In June, after pressure from the Free Democrat party that controls the transport ministry, the cabinet agreed to scrap the sectoral targets from its climate law altogether. Neubauer said: \u201cI think we will look back and they will look back and we\u2019re going to be deeply ashamed about what is happening right now \u2013 and how we see democracies under fire from the right, but also from the climate crisis.\u201d The government spokesperson said climate protection was a top priority for the federal government, and the goal of climate neutrality by 2045 was more important than ever. \u201cClimate protection efforts are successful when society and the state work together. We all bear responsibility for our environment. The young generation in particular has high expectations of politics for good reasons.\u201d The spokesperson listed several measures the government was taking to cut emissions, but did not address its failure to meet targets set out in its climate law. \u201cHonestly, right now, I don\u2019t know where this is going to end,\u201d said Neubauer. \u201cBecause activists are getting more frustrated, for all the good reasons, society is getting more aggressive for their reasons, and the police are standing inbetween, but clearly taking the side of those who are attacking activists \u2026 And our politicians pretend they have nothing to do with that. That\u2019s so cruel.\u201d ",

            "text": "A 21-year-old Indigenous activist from a remote Amazonian village will hand deliver a letter to the Cargill-MacMillan dynasty in Minneapolis on Thursday, calling on the billionaire owners of the US\u2019s biggest private company to stop destroying the Amazon rainforest and its people. Beka Saw Munduruku traveled more than 4,000 miles to confront the family behind Cargill, the world\u2019s largest grain trader and a major meat producer, over what she says amounts to a litany of broken promises that pose an existential threat to Indigenous peoples and the global climate. \u201cYour executives tell us that Cargill is a good company, that they have pledged to end the destruction of nature. But this is not our experience. In every region where Cargill operates, you are destroying the environment and driving out or threatening the communities who live there,\u201d writes Beka, whose requests for face-to-face meetings with family representatives went unanswered. \u201cDespite your many commitments to end deforestation, the destruction has increased \u2026 We have lived here in the heart of the Amazon for over 4,000 years. But now our world hangs by a thread.\u201d Beka is part of the Munduruku community of 13,000 people who live in 160 communities across three states in northern Brazil. \u201cWe are known as the Red Ants for our determined resistance and protection of our territory,\u201d she told the Guardian in New York \u2013 en route to Minneapolis. Beka\u2019s visit to the US is part of a campaign by Stand.Earth, a non-profit environmental watchdog with more than a million members globally, to pressure the Cargill-MacMillan clan to take responsibility for their company\u2019s harms. Numerous investigations have found that Cargill\u2019s grain supply chain continues to be linked to human rights abuses and deforestation in the Amazon forest and the Cerrado savanna, despite the company\u2019s promises to eradicate harmful practices. Cargill has promised to be \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d in the Amazon and Cerrado by 2025 and completely eradicate deforestation from all its supply chains by 2030. The company has previously said that it has put in place a sophisticated monitoring operation at ports, warehouses and other points in its supply chain. \u201cI understand that many others have denounced Cargill over the years, but the company has never changed. I believe it\u2019s important that young people bring a message to the Cargill family. We want our people to be heard and consulted,\u201d Beka said. \u201cWe want them to look at us and respect us and hear our call. Sending letters isn\u2019t enough, we need to show up and be present to be heard. This is personal.\u201d The family is the fourth richest in the US, with an estimated net worth of $47bn, according to Forbes. Beka was 12 years old when she first helped her father, a village chief, in a campaign to stop construction of a hydroelectric dam threatening to flood Munduruku and other Indigenous lands. Since then she has witnessed her village on the Tapajos River, in the state of Par\u00e1, battle mercury poisoning from illegal gold mining, deforestation by illegal loggers and diseases linked to agrotoxins and industrialized diets like diabetes and some cancers as communities have been denied access to their land, water and traditional food sources. Cargill stands out among the companies damaging the Amazon and its people, according to Beka. \u201cCargill is one of the main companies occupying our sacred lands to make money. Cargill is driving deforestation, and pressuring Indigenous people to leave as they can no longer fish and hunt which is the source of our food security, customs and wellbeing \u2026 Expanding soy on our lands leads to deforestation and global warming that affects everyone.\u201d The Cargill empire started as a grain storage facility in 1865, and continues to be owned by descendants of the founder William Cargill and his son-in-law John MacMillan. Family members own around 88% of the conglomerate \u2013 which reported $165bn in revenues last year \u2013 that produces, distributes and trades in beef, turkey, palm oil, grains, sugar, chocolate and pet food among other agricultural, food, beauty and financial products and services. \u201cWhile not necessarily engaged in the day-to-day business of the company, as its owners these individuals have the ultimate say over \u2013 and the ultimate responsibility for \u2013 Cargill\u2019s practices,\u201d said Mathew Jacobson, Stand.Earth\u2019s campaign director. The latest threat facing Beka\u2019s people and the region comes from a 620-mile railroad backed by Cargill known as Ferrogr\u00e3o, that would transport soya grown in Cerrado \u2013 a critical savanna ecosystem just south of the Amazon where communities already face land grabs from ranchers and contamination of their waterways and fish from pesticides. The railroad would bring additional transport capacity to the soy highway that currently connects the Cerrado to the Miritituba port in Par\u00e1, and could impact six Indigenous territories and three isolated tribes. Studies have found it would likely bring a slew of socio-economic harms to Indigenous peoples, encouraging soy and other commodity production that drive deforestation, and lead to tens of millions of tons of additional carbon emissions. In her letter, Beka lays out the potential devastating consequences to the family. \u201cLast year the forests and savannas of the Cerrado were destroyed at a rate of 8,000 acres a day \u2026 an area the size of your hometown of Minneapolis every five days. This railway will destroy 2,000 sq kilometers of the Amazon forests we live in \u2026 it will open our lands to more land grabbers and illegal miners and loggers that already invade and burn our lands and murder our people.\u201d The Brazilian supreme court suspended the Ferrogr\u00e3o in 2021, but recently opened the door for a revised plan before a final vote. Cargill has previously said that Brazil needs to continue investing in commodities infrastructure and that anyone opposing the Ferrogr\u00e3o is \u201cirresponsible\u201d. Beka said: \u201cThe Ferrogr\u00e3o railroad will bring a package of death and destruction to our territory and people. \u201cWe are fighting for our lives. For our land. For our cultures. For our children and grandchildren. This is not irresponsible \u2026 You have the power to stop this.\u201d \u201cBeka traveled all the way from her remote Amazonian village to bring a message directly to the Cargill-MacMillan family because her people have been forced to endure Cargill\u2019s destructive practices and broken promises firsthand and without recourse. The Munduruku are demanding that the family rein in the company\u2019s reckless conduct,\u201d said Paula Vargas, Amazon Watch Brazil program director. The spotlight on the family, which includes 12 billionaires, comes as Cargill is facing legal scrutiny on multiple fronts in relation to allegations of land grabs and broken promises on deforestation and Indigenous rights. In Brazil, federal prosecutors are investigating the US company and a local partner for alleged irregularities in land acquisitions in Abaetetuba, a coastal city in Par\u00e1, where the company wants to build a massive grain export terminal. In the US, the company is facing a legal challenge over its alleged failure to remove deforestation and human rights abuses from its soy supply chain in Brazil. Cargill did not respond to the allegations made in Beka\u2019s letter, but earlier this year in response to the US legal case told the Guardian that it had an \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to eliminate deforestation and conversion in South America. In line with this, it added: \u201cWe do not source soy from farmers who clear land in protected areas and have controls in place to prevent non-compliant product from entering our supply chains. If we find any violations of our policies, we take immediate action in accordance with our grievance process.\u201d Beka is now a spokesperson for the Mundurukus, and alongside Alessandra Korap Munduruku, who earlier this year was awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize for leading efforts to stop a British mining company encroaching on Indigenous lands, is part of a new generation of female Amazonian leaders demanding accountability. Beka said: \u201cThe people here who want to protect the Amazon need to look past the forest and see its peoples. Deforestation is linked to the blood of Indigenous people that is spilled in defending the lands that you are concerned about. People here are eating comfortably while we cannot eat our traditional foods as a result of these products. I consider this to be a great disrespect to our people.\u201d ",

The not-for-profit organisation Material Focus, which conducted the research, said the scale of the issue was huge and they wanted to encourage more recycling. More than half a billion cheaply priced electronic goods were bought in the UK in the past year alone \u2013 16 per second. Material Focus findings showed that of these items, 471m were thrown away. This included 260m disposable vapes, 26m cables, 29m LED, solar and decorative lights, 9.8m USB sticks, and 4.8m miniature fans. Scott Butler, executive director at Material Focus, described it as \u201cfast tech\u201d. He said: \u201cPeople should think carefully about buying some of the more frivolous \u2026 items in the first place.\u201d He said the items people bought were often \u201ccheap and small\u201d, and that consumers may not realise they contain valuable materials that could be salvaged if recycled. Small electricals can contain precious materials including copper, lithium and stainless steel. These components can be recycled and used in wind turbines, medical devices and electric vehicles. Material Focus said that while people were used to the idea of recycling larger electrical items such as fridges, lots of smaller devices were left unused in houses. In the average UK home, the research found, there were four to five charging cables, two to three mobile phones, and two to three remote controls cluttering up cupboards. Butler said: \u201cWe want to get the message across that anything with a plug, battery or cable can be recycled and there\u2019s somewhere near you to do it. The scale of the issue is huge, but there\u2019s an easy solution \u2013 just as the trend for recycling and repurposing fashion has grown and grown, we want to encourage the nation to recycle fast tech, guilt-free and fuss-free.\u201d Material Focus has created an online tool to guide consumers to nearby recycling points. Material Focus said that when consumers bought a cheap item, they saw it as disposable. They estimate that UK citizens spent more than \u00a32.8bn on these cheap products in the past year. The non-profit group described it as \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d when it comes to the growing issue of wasted electricals in the UK. More than 100,000 tonnes of waste electricals are thrown away every year, and there are 880m electrical items of all kinds lying unused in UK homes. A Material Focus survey of 2,000 people found that every year, the average UK adult buys nine electrical items cheaply and throws away eight. Some of the most likely items to be binned include mini speakers, handheld vacuum cleaners and step counters.  ",

            "text": "Sitting on a giant pile of fossil fuels in a year set to go down as the hottest on record \u2013 pockmarked by one flame-grilled disaster after another \u2013 requires some careful and creative public positioning. One must be careful not to completely ignore the climate crisis while trying to navigate a path that continues to justify drilling and burning Australia\u2019s fossil fuel du jour \u2013 gas. Speaking to the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Climate and Energy Summit this week, the resources minister, Madeleine King, reached for the compass in an 1,800-word speech that backed gas, which would be \u201cpart of the world\u2019s energy mix for the foreseeable future.\u201d  Australia would continue to be a trusted and reliable supplier of liquified natural gas, King told the summit. The country\u2019s gas was helping the region prosper. \u201cThe [International Energy Agency] has acknowledged that in all of its transition scenarios, continued investment in gas will be needed to meet demand,\u201d she said. The IEA last month updated its thinking on how economies could collectively work to meet a global goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Related: Energy consumer lobby calls for Australia-wide ban on gas connections in new homes  King\u2019s interpretation of the IEA\u2019s official position isn\u2019t wrong, but importantly \u2013 given she is speaking about the future of energy \u2013 it is incomplete. What the IEA also said last month was that \u201cno new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects\u201d were needed in its net zero scenario (and neither are new coalmines or \u201cunabated\u201d coal power plants). Even without any new climate policies, the speed of the rollout of clean energy meant the agency was now projecting that \u201cdemand for coal, oil and natural gas will all peak this decade\u201d. King provided plentiful statistics in her speech. Australia\u2019s LNG sales to Japan were worth an estimated $34bn. Australia\u2019s LNG industry made up 21% of the global market for liquified gas. Of the country\u2019s gas production, 70% is exported (actually, when you count all the gas used in the production of LNG, the latest government figures suggest it\u2019s more like 83%). What did she have to say about emissions? In reference to gas, she offered one sentence. \u201cEqually, gas and the gas sector are a significant source of Australian greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d she said. Well, there\u2019s also a statistic for that. According to the government\u2019s own draft Future of Gas Strategy document, the country\u2019s gas industry is responsible for a whopping 21% of the country\u2019s entire footprint. That\u2019s an interesting observation of an industry that\u2019s trying to position itself as part of the solution to the climate crisis. So 21% of the country\u2019s carbon footprint comes from the gas industry. That is something not to be sneezed at. What else should we not be sneezing at? King said: \u201cAustralia hosts the world\u2019s largest commercial CCS project, Chevron\u2019s Gorgon LNG project at Barrow Island in Western Australia. Eight million tonnes of stored CO2 is not to be sneezed at.\u201d  Related: Australian governments need to set clear policy direction for gas sector, says regulator  CCS (carbon capture and storage) is the perennially over-promising and grossly under-delivering set of technologies to capture carbon dioxide and then store it. Dogged by delays and underperformance, Chevron\u2019s carbon capture project started injecting CO2 captured from its gasfield in August 2019. So that\u2019s eight million tonnes in a little less than four years. But that amount is eclipsed by the total greenhouse gases from the project and the burning of the gas, which Chevron estimates to be 49.8m tonnes every year. That\u2019s certainly not to be sneezed at. Speaking to the AFR this week, the boss of the major gas producer Santos, Kevin Gallagher, appeared to deploy a classic strawman argument while defending the fortunes of the product his company sells. The newspaper reported: \u201cGallagher said government policies to drive decarbonisation should not focus on one solution or technology \u201cbecause that\u2019s not going to deliver us what we want\u201d. Absolutely nobody in the energy industry, anywhere, at any time, has ever suggested that government policy should focus on \u201cone solution or technology\u201d. Gallagher told the newspaper\u2019s energy summit he was \u201cnot sure the world can leave fossil fuels behind\u201d and said he was confident there would be \u201ca very big place for gas in the future.\u201d This doesn\u2019t sound like the boss of a company that says its climate policies are aligned with the UN\u2019s sustainable development goal of taking \u201curgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\u201d. Nor does it chime with the view of the IEA that, as already mentioned, thinks demand for gas will peak this decade even without new climate policies. The IEA\u2019s updated net zero scenario for the globe\u2019s energy industry suggests demand for natural gas drops from 4,150bn cubic metres in 2022 to 3,400bcm in 2030 and 900bcm in 2050. That suggests if companies and governments are serious about meeting a 1.5C global temperature goal, then gas doesn\u2019t occupy a \u201cvery big place\u201d in the future, but rather an increasingly small one. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2023 to correct some errors of scale in the IEA\u2019s updated net zero scenario.

            "text": "Australia's resources minister, Madeleine King, recently spoke at the Australian Financial Review's Climate and Energy Summit. In her speech, she emphasized the importance of gas as part of the world's energy mix. King stated that Australia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry plays a significant role in the global market, with 70% of the country's gas production being exported. However, it's worth noting that the gas sector is also responsible for a substantial amount of Australian greenhouse gas emissions, contributing 21% to the country's carbon footprint.\n\nKing mentioned the International Energy Agency's (IEA) acknowledgment that continued investment in gas is necessary to meet energy demand. However, it's important to consider the IEA's net zero scenario, which states that no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed. The IEA also projects that demand for coal, oil, and natural gas will peak in this decade due to the increasing rollout of clean energy.\n\nOne of Australia's achievements in the gas industry is Chevron's Gorgon LNG project, which hosts the world's largest commercial carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. While the project has stored eight million tonnes of CO2, the total greenhouse gas emissions from the project and the burning of gas amount to 49.8 million tonnes per year.\n\nKevin Gallagher, the CEO of Santos, another major gas producer, defended the importance of gas in the future. However, his statement doesn't align with the goal of combating climate change and reducing emissions. The IEA's net zero scenario indicates a decrease in natural gas demand if we aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIt's crucial to consider a variety of solutions and technologies to address the climate crisis rather than relying solely on gas. Governments and companies must prioritize sustainable development goals and work towards reducing emissions.",

            "text": "There are more seabirds nesting on the island of Lundy than at any time since the 1930s, conservationists have revealed. The tiny island in the Bristol Channel, a globally famed location for Britain\u2019s seabirds, is now home to 25,000 Manx shearwaters \u2013 95% of England\u2019s breeding population \u2013 as well as 1,335 puffins and more than 150 pairs of storm petrels, a species that only arrived on the island in 2014. Despite the recent threat of avian flu, which has decimated wild bird populations in some of the world\u2019s most sensitive locations, and the problematic decline in wild sources of food such as sand eels, the total number of seabirds on Lundy stood at 40,000 this summer. This is a massive turnaround after just 7,351 remained in 2000. Puffins were close to extinction, with just 13 counted on the windswept 450-hectare island in 2001.  Related: Seabirds treble on Lundy after island is declared rat-free  But a drive to remove rats from the island has helped numbers to rebound. Black and brown rats, which arrived on Lundy as stowaways on ships over many decades, had been preying on the eggs and chicks, particularly those of burrow-nesting shearwaters and puffins. The rats were eradicated in a partnership led by the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust and the National Trust between 2002 and 2004 \u2013 a move that was opposed at the time by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats. Since the island was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators let loose by humans have been removed. Paul St Pierre, a conservation officer for the RSPB, said: \u201cPartnership projects like this show just how much potential there is to restore species and landscapes on an incredible scale. \u201cIf we can restore over 30,000 birds to one small island in the Bristol Channel, just imagine how much could be achieved if everyone came together to restore nature right across the UK.\u201d Ongoing biosecurity work has ensured no rats have returned to Lundy on boats, while annual surveying has revealed the dramatic population recovery. Global populations of seabirds have fallen by 70% since the 1950s, and in northern Britain most seabird populations have experienced significant declines in recent years. But more southerly summer populations of seabirds that feed in the waters off south Wales and south-west England have largely bucked this downward trend. Derek Green, the general manager of Lundy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted by the dramatic increase of seabirds on Lundy in recent years. Conservation is at the heart of everything we do on the island and we look forward to continuing to nurture this very special place for future generations to enjoy.\u201d British coasts are internationally important for many species including puffins, grey seals and Manx shearwaters, with more than 80% of the world\u2019s population nesting in the country. The revival recalls the abundance of the 1930s: in 1939 it was estimated that Lundy was home to 80,000 seabirds. ",

            "text": "Conservationists have made an exciting discovery on the island of Lundy. They have found that there are more seabirds nesting there now than at any time since the 1930s. Lundy is a small island in the Bristol Channel, which is famous for its seabirds in Britain. It is now home to 25,000 Manx shearwaters, which make up 95% of England's breeding population. There are also 1,335 puffins and over 150 pairs of storm petrels, a species that only arrived on the island in 2014.\n\nThis is great news because the number of seabirds on Lundy has been increasing, even though there have been some challenges. For example, there was a threat of avian flu, which has harmed bird populations in other sensitive places around the world. Additionally, there has been a decline in the food sources for the birds on Lundy, such as sand eels. However, despite these challenges, the total number of seabirds on the island this summer was 40,000. This is a huge improvement compared to the 7,351 that remained in 2000. Puffins, in particular, were close to extinction with only 13 of them counted on the island in 2001.\n\nThe increase in seabirds can be attributed to a project to remove rats from the island. Black and brown rats had been preying on the eggs and chicks of the seabirds, especially the shearwaters and puffins that nest in burrows. The rats were removed from Lundy between 2002 and 2004 by a partnership led by organizations like the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust, and the National Trust. This was not without controversy, as some animal rights groups opposed the removal of the rats, arguing that conservationists were prioritizing the birds that tourists like over the rats.\n\nAfter the rats were removed, the seabird populations on Lundy started to bounce back. This is a common trend on small islands when invasive predators brought by humans are eliminated. The island was declared rat-free in 2006, and since then, the seabird populations have been recovering. The ongoing biosecurity work ensures that no rats return to Lundy on boats, and regular surveys have shown the impressive population recovery.\n\nSeabird populations have been declining globally, with a 70% decrease since the 1950s. In northern Britain, many seabird populations have also experienced significant declines in recent years. However, the summer populations of seabirds that feed off the coasts of south Wales and southwest England have been bucking this trend. Lundy's success in restoring its seabird populations gives hope for the potential to restore nature on a larger scale across the UK.\n\nLundy is an important place for many species, including puffins, grey seals, and Manx shearwaters. In fact, more than 80% of the world's population of Manx shearwaters nest in the UK. The increase in seabirds on Lundy is reminiscent of the 1930s when it was estimated that the island was home to 80,000 seabirds.\n\nThe team managing Lundy is thrilled with the increase in seabirds and is committed to continuing their conservation efforts on the island. They want to ensure that future generations can also enjoy this special place.",

            "text": "Oil giant ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5bn in a deal that places a vast bet on a future for fossil fuel production in the United States. America\u2019s largest oil and gas deal in more than two decades will increase Exxon\u2019s dominance in the Permian Basin shale field, at the heart of the country\u2019s transformation into the world\u2019s biggest oil producer. Shares in Exxon have almost doubled over the past two years as oil and gas prices rose sharply. Its takeover of Pioneer \u2013 an all-stock transaction \u2013 capitalizes on this market rally. While the Biden administration has sought to hasten the shift towards renewable energy in the face of the climate crisis, this acquisition underlines the confidence of America\u2019s largest oil company that fossil fuel output will not be significantly hampered in the coming years. With shareholders in Pioneer set to vote on the proposed tie-up, Scott Sheffield, the operator\u2019s chief executive, declared the combined fracking giant would create value for them \u201cfor decades to come\u201d. Darren Woods, chief executive and chairman of Exxon, said: \u201cPioneer is a clear leader in the Permian with a unique asset base and people with deep industry knowledge. The combined capabilities of our two companies will provide long-term value creation well in excess of what either company is capable of doing on a standalone basis.\u201d This would be ExxonMobil\u2019s biggest deal since Exxon\u2019s $75bn merger with Mobil Oil in 1998. Together, Exxon and Pioneer are set to have \u201cthe largest footprint of high-return wells in the Permian Basin\u201d, Sheffield noted. Exxon\u2019s production in the Permian would more than double to 1.3m barrels of oil equivalent per day following the purchase, it said. This is expected to rise to about 2m barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2027. The company is pitching the takeover as environmentally friendly, however. It pledged to leverage its \u201cindustry-leading\u201d greenhouse gas reduction plans in the Permian, which Woods said will to \u201caccelerate Pioneer\u2019s net-zero plan from 2050 to 2035\u201d. The deal \u2013 expected to close in the first half of next year \u2013 is subject to regulatory approvals. The boards of Exxon and Pioneer have already granted the green light. It values Pioneer at $253 per share, which amounts to a 9% premium on where the operator\u2019s stock was trading about a month before reports of takeover talks first surfaced. Shares in Pioneer Natural Resources climbed 0.3% to $238.10 on Wednesday. Exxon dropped 4.8% to $105.11. Unlike some of its rivals, Exxon has so far defied calls to move away from fossil fuels and concentrate on cleaner energy sources. Rather than place big bets on the shift to renewable energy, the oil giant has instead focused on its core business. The company\u2019s annual profits soared to a record $55.7bn last year, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine triggered a surge in oil prices. President Biden accused the industry of \u201cwar profiteering\u201d as prices rose at the pump. Exxon claimed on Wednesday that its purchase of Pioneer would both strengthen energy security and bolster the US economy. \u201cExxonMobil expanding is bad for people, communities, and our climate,\u201d said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at nonprofit research and advocacy group Oil Change International. \u201cFurther consolidation of the fossil energy market into a smaller number of mega companies will not secure energy access for people or help achieve climate targets.\u201d A recent analysis by Tong\u2019s group found that, despite their climate pledges, no major oil and gas company comes close to aligning with the 2015 Paris Agreement, a groundbreaking international treaty aimed at keeping global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels. The non-profit environmental advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund has raised concerns that the deal will reduce transparency around methane emissions, which are 80 times more planet-warming than carbon emissions in the short term. Pioneer has been an industry leader in methane reporting, but the group expressed fear that Exxon\u2019s acquisition will likely mean that those practices \u201cwould likely revert to Exxon\u2019s own outdated and inadequate practices\u201d.

This is a very large deal and shows that ExxonMobil believes there is still a future for fossil fuels, like oil and gas, in the United States. The deal will make ExxonMobil even more powerful in the Permian Basin shale field, which is where a lot of oil is produced. ExxonMobil's shares have been doing well because oil and gas prices have been going up. This deal takes advantage of that. Even though the Biden administration wants to focus more on renewable energy because of climate change, ExxonMobil is confident that fossil fuel production will continue to be important for many years. Pioneer's shareholders will vote on the deal soon. The CEO of Pioneer said that this combined company will create value for them for a long time. The CEO of ExxonMobil said that Pioneer is a leader in the Permian and that the two companies together will be able to do more than they could on their own. This is the biggest deal for ExxonMobil since it merged with Mobil Oil in 1998. Together, ExxonMobil and Pioneer will have the most high-return wells in the Permian Basin. ExxonMobil's production in the Permian will more than double after this deal. The company says that it is also good for the environment because it will use its plans to reduce greenhouse gases in the Permian. The deal still needs to be approved by regulators, but the boards of ExxonMobil and Pioneer have already agreed to it. Pioneer's value is $253 per share, which is 9% more than it was before the takeover talks started. Pioneer's shares went up a little bit after the deal was announced, while ExxonMobil's shares went down. Unlike some other big oil companies, ExxonMobil has not focused on renewable energy. Instead, it has focused on its main business of producing oil and gas. The company made a lot of money last year because oil prices went up after Russia invaded Ukraine. President Biden criticized the industry for making so much money while regular people had to pay more for gas. ExxonMobil says that this deal will make the country more secure and help the economy. Some people are worried about the deal. They say that ExxonMobil getting bigger is bad for the environment and for communities. They also worry that the deal will make it harder to reduce methane emissions, which are very bad for the planet. Pioneer has been good at reporting its methane emissions, but people think that ExxonMobil won't be as good at it.",

The felled sycamore, which because of its location had been one of the most photographed trees in the UK, must be removed to protect the 1,900-year-old Roman wall and make the site safe, according to the National Trust. \u201cToday we\u2019re beginning the careful task of preparing the site, before the tree is lifted by crane tomorrow and transported to a safe location,\u201d said Andrew Poad, the site\u2019s general manager for the National Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s currently in a precarious position resting on the wall, so it\u2019s necessary we move it now, to preserve the world-famous monument that is Hadrian\u2019s Wall, and to make the site safe again for visitors.\u201d It is not possible to lift the trunk in one piece so it will be sawn up, although conservationists want to keep the sections as large as possible.

He said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this tree captured the imaginations of so many people who visited, and that it held a special \u2013 and often poignant \u2013 place in many people\u2019s hearts.\u201d The question of what to do with the site is uncertain. Ideas put forward include making a memorial bench using the timber, or displaying a cross-section of the trunk that would allow people to see inside the original tree. Poad said the trust was working with partners \u201cto find the best way of paying tribute to this much-loved tree and involving the public in this process\u201d.  Related: What may happen next at Sycamore Gap tree felling site?  \u201cThe nature of the site, which is designated by Unesco and is a scheduled ancient monument, means our plans must be carefully thought through. We kindly ask people to please bear with us while we consider what might be possible.\u201d Tony Gates, the chief executive officer of Northumberland National Park Authority, said: \u201cThe intention is to ensure that the tree is stored safely so that full consideration can be given to how best to use the tree in future.\u201d Kim McGuinness, the police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, said felling the tree was like \u201cstealing joy\u201d. Two arrests have been made in the search for those responsible, and a 16-year-old boy and man in his 60s remain on police bail as investigations continue.

On Thursday, a big machine will lift the 50-foot tree off the wall in Northumberland and it will be put in a secret place owned by the National Trust. The tree was very famous and lots of people took pictures of it. The National Trust is removing the tree to protect the very old Roman wall and make the place safe again for visitors. Andrew Poad, who is in charge of the site, said they are getting ready to move the tree and keep it safe. They can't lift the whole tree, so they will cut it up into pieces. They want to keep the pieces as big as they can. They are putting a fence around the part of the tree that is left in the ground, and they hope it will grow new shoots. They also collected seeds from the tree to try to grow new ones. Historic England checked the wall and found some damage when the tree fell. They are asking people to stay away from the site while they remove the tree. Poad said they are grateful for all the help and kind words from the public. They are not sure what to do with the site yet. Some ideas are to make a bench out of the wood or to show a cross-section of the tree trunk so people can see inside. Poad said they are working with other groups to figure out the best way to honor the tree and include the public in the decision. They have to be careful because the site is very important and has special rules. The tree will be stored safely for now while they decide what to do with it. The police have arrested two people in connection with the tree being cut down. A 16-year-old boy and a man in his 60s are being investigated.",

            "text": "There are few things so quintessentially English as the allotment, but the number of people waiting for a space of their own has almost doubled in the last 12 years.  The most recent figures, obtained by independent artists and supported by Greenpeace through freedom of information requests, show there are now at least 157,820 applications sitting on English local authorities\u2019 allotment waiting lists, up 81% from 12 years ago when researchers found the figure was 86,787. Campaigners say this rise is due to a combination of high demand and delay in turning over plots that are not being properly used. In preparation for the launch of a new piece of activist art, researchers found that across Britain, 174,183 applications were sitting on local authority allotment waiting lists. The average waiting time for an allotment was three years, while residents of Islington, north London, faced a 15-year wait.  The local authority with the longest waiting list was Bristol, with 7,630 outstanding applications, followed by Sunderland, Portsmouth, Southampton, Edinburgh and Manchester. Greenpeace said the numbers of applicants demonstrated a desire among people to find new ways to tackle the intensifying cost of living, climate, nature and health crises. The tradition of allotment holding in Britain harks back to Anglo-Saxon times when swathes of land were commonly held for growing food, grazing livestock and collecting firewood, before the enclosure acts, over four centuries, where aristocrats fenced off public land for their own use.  The modern system of allotments \u2013 named for small patches of land attached to tenant farmers cottages \u2013 emerged in the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century the Allotment Act imposed a legal responsibility on local authorities to meet residents\u2019 demand for allotments. A spokesperson for the National Allotment Society (NAS) said the steady increase in demand for allotments had been down to the cost of living crisis, the increased interest in \u201cgrowing your own\u201d during Covid, and better awareness of sustainable growing and healthy eating.The NAS campaigns to encourage housebuilders to incorporate allotments in new developments and also works with local authorities to ensure existing sites are properly managed. \u201cOften usable plots stand vacant for periods of time,\u201d the NAS said. \u201cVacancies due to issues with eviction, overgrown plots or lack of access are frustrating for those waiting years to get their hands on a plot.\u201d Daniela Montalto, a Greenpeace UK forests campaigner, said: \u201cAllotment waiting lists demonstrate a huge desire from people to be part of the solution to our broken food system but without access to land, the many benefits of community food growing to people, nature and the climate are being stifled. \u201cThe government must support councils to act as well as take seriously its own role in creating systemic and lasting change to the food system. Crucial steps include proper support for farmers to transition to climate-, people- and nature-friendly farming as well as measures to reduce our climate footprint abroad including a ban on imports of soya and other agricultural commodities that drive deforestation in places like Brazil.\u201d Collaborating with artists JC Niala, Julia Utreras and Sam Skinner, Greenpeace used the data to inform a 30 metre-long work of living art embedded with clusters of seeds and ash from burned portions of the Amazon rainforest. The artwork, which was displayed at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, on Wednesday morning spelled out the message \u201cWe the 174,183 demand allotments\u201d. Niala, the lead artist behind the project, said: \u201cWith the acceleration of climate change and the persistence of structural inequality within the UK and globally, food has become both an emblem and an embodiment of the troubles around us. \u201cAllotments quite literally provide a lifeline for some. They bring good local food back to people and take away the bad taste of the global industrial food system. They improve people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing by creating a sense of purpose and increasing opportunities to connect with others as well as spend time in nature.\u201d  ",

David Cooper, acting executive secretary for the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD), told the Guardian he believed the public mood was not moving against greater environmental protections, and that vested interests opposed to action on the climate crisis and nature loss were trying to frustrate progress. The comments come after a series of backtracks on climate commitments by the UK government and a political backlash against nature restoration policies in the EU from farming, forestry and fishing industries. Less than a year after governments agreed this decade\u2019s targets to halt the destruction of the natural world, Cooper said that while meeting some climate and biodiversity targets required short-term tradeoffs, they were vital for maintaining a habitable planet now and in the future. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that the public mood as a whole is moving against the environment. The public as a whole, and particularly young people, see this as more and more important,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cWe see some backtracking in different parts of the world but a lot of this is political groups trying to find wedge issues to gain a marginal advantage in an upcoming election,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the public are allowed to express their views, they come up with good decisions.\u201d He cited the recent citizens\u2019 assembly on biodiversity in Ireland and the vote in Ecuador against continuing with oil and gas exploration in the Amazon rainforest as moments when the public had pushed for stronger environmental protections. \u201cPeople are actually ahead of the governments. We must not allow ourselves to be persuaded that there is a pushback by the public as a whole,\u201d he said. Cooper said he accepted there were sometimes costs in the short term to environmental policies, but said governments should work with communities who felt threatened to find a way forward.  Related: Flagship EU law to restore nature must not be derailed, warns environment chief  \u201c[The pushback] is partly led by politicians speaking to their base and \u2026 vested interests that will do what they can to deny some of the issues we\u2019re facing in climate change, biodiversity loss and the like,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cThe goals and targets of these environmental agreements are ambitious. They\u2019re not easy to achieve, and they\u2019re not going to be achieved only by incremental action, even though that\u2019s an important part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is very clear that it\u2019s absolutely essential to meet them if we want a habitable planet, perhaps even for ourselves, but certainly for our children.\u201d This article was amended on 11 October 2023 to reflect that Cooper cited the citizens\u2019 assembly on biodiversity loss in Ireland, not the UK-wide citizen\u2019s assembly on nature.
